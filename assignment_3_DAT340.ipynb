The Cafe is well recommended. Good service and we enjoyed our teas and a Cinamon Roll. The latter was large but so good that between us we finished it! Recommended stop off.', 'Bad experience, On 23/03/19 Myself and my partner arrived at 20.00 and were promptly sent to the bar and told it would be roughly a 30 minute wait by the blonde lady at the front desk, she was impolite to start. After 50 minutes(and when we noticed the couple that arrived after us were seated before us) I went to talk again and she said they will be as quick as possible. Another 15 minutes passed during which another couple who arrived after us were seated. This happened a third time and then we left after paying for our drinks feeling like we were ignored. The bar tenders were fantastic however the floor greeting staff were rude and self righteous. Won’t be going back. Bad experience.', 'Extremely underwhelming experience here last night. Group of friends on a girly weekend pre booked a table in sushi samba, as the reviews were good. We arrived bang on time for our reservation, front door staff were welcoming and attentive, however it went downhill fast from here. Arrived to the restaurant and we advised of our booking to be told the table was still occupied and they were waiting for the table to settle up so we were told to wait at the bar area, we all got a drink and went to sit at one of the bar tables to be told “you can’t see there, customers only” - shocked at this we went back to the front of house to ask how much longer our table would be to be told the previous table still hadn’t settled up, again no apology, this was 25mins after our reserved time of booking. We tried to sit at a small bar table overlooking the gorgeous views of London to again be told there was too many of us for that particular table, no alternative offered only what could be described as rudeness. 35 mins after our booking time we were brought to our table with not one apology or acknowledgement of the wait or rude service we had already experienced, we understand that sometimes there is a short wait for at table however this is normally acceptable with a sincere apology and enjoyable “drinks in the bar while you wait” experience. Overall we can’t deny that the food was delicious, however, the overall experience was underwhelming and not worth the money you pay.', 'Waited 30 minutes to get a table…that was ok. Sat at the table and waited as our server passed by and not greet us at least 3 times. 15 minutes of sitting there, I walked up to the hostess and asked her to let the server know we were waiting. The waitress went to one of her other tables and asked them what they needed because they called her. They stated that they didn’t call. I explained that I called her and she said “I’m taking care of their food first and then I will be over.” At this point I would have been happy with a drink. 10 more minutes and she takes our order. Still no drinks. So I called and asked the manager on the phone for drinks and she seems herself too busy. Horrible experience. 0/5 stars. Still waiting to just eat so we can get out!

I tried a lot of breakfast places but this one is the a winner because its very special. The food taste is unique and different, they keep serving until you are full and satesfied. Different types of Jam which are amazing. And the bread is fresh and yummy, and they keep serving it. They put a tea pot on the table so you can serve ur self, which tastes wonderful as well.

Food was fast but you had to come get it yourself, if I pay 75 for sushi that's fine but 150 with drink and no other customers and just leaving it at the register for us to come get seems lazy at best. Sushi was served with an enormous amount of rice with each piece and since they served it on paper plates.... the rice stuck to the plate. Fish didn't taste of anything and neither did the rice. Wasabi ran out after 3 pieces and the pickled ginger could have been served on a teaspoon. There are plenty of other sushi restaurants with better value, better service and better food close by, even on the same street.

Bacon tasty but underdone, bread not toasted properly (I'm guessing they forgot about our order and rushed it out), black pudding too dry, one mediocre sausage. Will not be returning.\", 'Have been there several times when first opened. At my late visits i had \"hair\" in my kebap 2 times and the owner did not even get embarrassed from this terrible situation.

The water in the table which we didn't even open was charged. Compulsory service charge which they wouldn't remove even though they were more interested in watching the football. Joke. Oh and the food was average at best. My £15 king prawn curry had 3 prawns and about 10 tomato's to bulk it out. Don't go. Please\", 'The girl at the window was very rude! ! We have to be nice to each other in this world', 'We arrived hoping to sit on the balcony and watch the fountain display at The Billagio; however, the wait was at least 40 minutes, so took a table just outside the restaurant looking toward the lobby. The waiter came to take our order and the choice of wine. We ordered appetizers and he left. In less than 10 minutes we had two appetizers but no wine and no one came to take our order for the main course. We ordered steaks and fries and they arrived as my companion was just finishing her artichoke. Her steak - a filet mignon - was rare but not the ‘blue’ rare that she ordered. It was difficult to say how mine was cooked since the first bite was at least medium well and the last was close to medium rare, which I ordered. The problem was the medium rare section was un-chewable.  The food and the service were unacceptable given the status of the restaurant.', 'Nice guys but terrible restaurant and expensive even by London standards.', 'Club A Steakhouse is hands-down one of the best dining experiences in the city. The food, the service, and the ambiance is amazing in this neighborhood gem. We enjoyed the best lemon drop martinis before our perfectly cooked steaks arrived.

I hate to be that guy, but I think had I of known the food was that bad - I would have reconsidered', 'This was the best meal I have ever had. Tony made us feel special and made my birthday and last dinner in Boston wonderful!!!!! He was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Also, my husband eats like the child and Tony made sure he got something he liked that wasn’t even on the menu. Food and drinks were the best! We will for sure be back.', \"The restaurant itself was nice but the taste of the meat was horrendous. I was with a party of 9 and they started us off with the lamb and every meat after had the taste of lamb. The service was ok but they served us a little too quickly, I felt rushed to eat and to pay. My business certainly did not feel appreciated and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you like a salad bar.\", 'A bit pricey for what you are getting…. Three stars for the service, the food was nothing to rave about, especially at those prices.

Yes, it is pricey, but this is what you get with the high price tag: Fantastic steak - probably the best I’ve ever tasted! Top-notch service - and trust me, I KNOW WHAT GOOD SERVICE IS, used to work in the industry. Great vibe and live DJ in the house - loved loved loved the upbeat music throughout our dinner, which was also at perfect volume. Beautiful experience of their Show of Serving Steak and Baklava! The restaurant is perfect for special occasions or just a moment of indulgence.

The venue is nice and has a welcoming atmosphere for everyone. It’s off the beaten track a little bit and tucked in around lots of nice houses. The staff are welcoming and friendly. The music was cool. Toilets are small and tucked between the front of house and kitchen meaning you need to queue where the waiters and waitresses need to get through but I guess there’s very little anyone can do about that and it’s not necessarily a consideration of my review just an observation. The food was ok. It wasn’t as great as one of the other restaurants I have been to. The laundrette burger comes with a LOT of melting cheese. It’s tasty, but it’s really messy to eat and somewhat of a challenge. The rest of our party all enjoyed their meals and the cocktails looked fantastic.', 'Cheap beer but unpleasant serving staff.', \"Oily, not fresh, cold food. No staff manner!

', \"Best Ramen i ever ate in europe. Soup's exploding with rich taste, Noodles are not from this planet. Just sitting in the atmospheric restaurant, takin it all in and smelling the broth boiling in the big pots in the open kitchen is taking you to another dimension. Also the desserts is not to miss. The long line outside the restaurant speaks for itself. Get there early but most important: GO!\", 'For the price you are paying, you will get something else better nearby.

We could not finish what we thought was a light dinner. The ingredients were not fresh. The spicing was off in a weird way.', 'The service was great.

Had the jd chicken it was really nice. Our waitress Sade was very helpful too', \"Regina is an old fashioned pizza place. They make an amazing pie. They have outdoor seating as well as indoor tables. You can also walk in and order a slice at the bar. As a native New Yorker, I found their pizza to be great. I'd can't wait to go back there.\", 'Went there based on good reviews in Google. Was sorely disappointed. The staff at the entrance was super nice and friendly. The waiters inside were thuggish. Based on other reviews there were some pretty nasty ones among some very good ones at this restaurant. Reviewers who are familiar with Indian food will objectively rate the food as average at best. The ravers are probably folks who had not visited many Indian restaurants. Considering that your dining experince as well as your day will be totally ruined if you run into the really rude waiters lurking inside, should seriously consider going somewhere else.', 'They serve the best burger ever. Fresh ingredients, juicy flavor. The Chut Up Chutney Burger was the most delicious burger Ive ever had. I absolutely recommend it.', 'We’ve driven past Alice’s innumerable times at the weekend, but never stopped as it was always packed with a full parking lot and line outside. So we decided to visit in the week for brunch and found it far quieter and more civilised. Brunch menu was good with everything you’d expect - from french toast to biscuits and gravy. We went for the steak and eggs (medium rare) and eggs Benedict. The steak was done to perfection and the eggs Benedict was good - though had a touch too much sauce. The setting is lovely and coffee was strong - definitely worth a stop at this classic diner.', 'I went today with my gf to try for first time a japanese restaurant,and we did not expect been overcharged for ordering the food through their app. They charged us £2.99 for only admin fees. We felt ripped off.The food tasted good but expensive for sushi portion. Staff was friendly and service was quick.', 'Poor dining experience Staff were impolite Food were bad', \"Would probably avoid if you've got a larger group...they're not equipped and their staff/system isn't set up to handle the volume. Disorganised and a bit rude. Plenty of other friendlier places.\", 'Tired venue urgently needs some money spent on it. Looks like a greasy spoon cafe.

Lovely avocado salad.. Highly recommended', 'I had a lovely dinner there with my friend, as my pre-birthday kickoff. We enjoyed all food we ordered, they are tasty and well presented.

I highly recommend trying this restaurant.\", 'We had a fabulous evening which was great as we celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was not cheap but the fact we had numerous cocktails and a bottle of wine did not help. We found the list of cocktails quite comprehensive and the food was truly delicious. The waiters were very attentive to our every need so the service was excellent (thank you Nola for looking after us so well). And the cherry on top was the 4-piece live band playing some Jazz music.

Went for dinner and ordered pepper crab and chilli crab. Both crabs were TINY (The irony!); waiter said 1 kg each but both were max 600 grams. Pepper crab was the worst ive had and it had NO sauce.

When we arrived, we were seated immediately in a comfortable corner booth, even though the restaurant was absolutely packed. My wife and I each had the Super-Lump Crab Cake as appetizers, followed by Lobster Bisque. The Lobster Niçoise served as my wife's entrée, and I had the Whole Mediterranean Branzino. My wife ordered wine by the glass, and I enjoyed two excellent cocktails, The Old Hudson. Our food was delicious, and our server was extremely attentive and friendly. Our overall experience was outstanding. When I read negative reviews, I can only imagine people who are either foreign to the concept of fine dining or, more likely, people who are simply riding on far too high a horse.\", 'Sliders and Drinks were awesome and the food was good as well. The young lady who waited on us was ok. The bartender was good. Drinks were tasty.', 'The food was mediocre to say the least. The lasagna looked like it had been microwaved.

I was clearly disappointed by the quality of the food.', \"Very disappointed, the front desk was very unhelpful and lied to our faces that there was no space available. Could tell he was lying so went online and tables were available to book that night. Could tell that this was racist behaviour even the look he gave my partner as if our money weren't good enough for there.

There was no wow factor.Having eaten at the previously mentioned establishments there was no comparison.The waiters were slow, and lacked and personal touch... 20mins and no drinks which is basic..Looking at the other reviews it looks like I went to a different restaurant (I have checked), hence the confusion....Must have caught this on the wrong night....

Raspberry babka for desert was a great end to the meal.', \"I visited with my sister for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. It was about half full when we arrived but thinned out once we'd ordered. Our order - a blue cheese and pancetta salad and a 'chorizo' burger - took rather a long time to arrive. Over half an hour.My sister immediately remarked upon how small the salad was. This is a main course salad priced at (I think) £11.50, so one would reasonably expect it to be at least a half decent plateful. But it was tiny. Now to my burger. It was described on the menu as coming with chorizo, manchego cheese, membrillo jelly and smoked paprika mayonnaise. As I sat examining the innards of the arrangement, searching for any trace of said accessories, our server approached to ask if everything was OK. I said 'not really', and explained that my burger appeared only to have a tiny sliver of cheese within, and nothing else, bar a slice of beef tomato, some lettuce and a smear of chutney. I also mentioned that my sister's salad looked very mean. The server - who was perfectly friendly and polite - removed the burger then a few minutes later returned with burger v2, described as 'fully loaded' with an apology that the chef had 'dropped the ball on that one'. The size of salad was explained as quite simply, er, the size that it is. Burger v2 was better, but still terrible. Utterly cremated beef patty, dry as a bone inside, a paper-thin slice of chorizo, a pretty miserable slice of cheese, no trace of membrillo jelly, and possible some smoked paprika mayonnaise. I was starving hungry so ate it, but is was not a good experience. My sister's salad tasted fine but she could have eaten two.When it was time to pay, the restaurant did knock 10% off the bill, which was appreciated, but sadly not enough, considering how bad the burger was. Friends and family have eaten here many times and always been happy with what they've had, but this was seriously a burger that would've been hard to do any worse. And it was something like £13.

We shared a mix platter of cooked meats and cheese to start. Whilst it wasn't terrible, it wasn't amazing. The bread served with it wasn't that fresh. Another sizeable wait occurred for the mains. I choose a Golonka, a dish I've ate in Poland many times. Whilst it wasn't the worst I've ever had, it wasn't great and lacked any real flavour. The potatoes which accompanied it were also hard.

We called the waiter over and asked for a drink and said we were ready to order at 2.25 as we were in a bit of a rush. We then had to ask someone else if we could order at 2.30 and ordered at about 2.35. The food turned up (after we’d asked how long it would be a few times) at 3.25 which is a ridiculous wait for a near empty restaurant.I won’t be going back here.

When I requested a larger table I was told they didn't have anything but would check downstairs to see what they could do. As we arrived at our table downstairs (a table for four) we noticed six other tables for four that only had two people at them??!!?? I can't understand why they were trying to squeeze us at such a small table when there was plenty of room.The food was mediocre at best. My hangar steak came out pre-sliced which was not mentioned on the menu and very upsetting. I know why restaurants pre-slice steak, it's because it looks like a larger portion when it's sliced and each piece is laid on its side. When I asked why my steak was pre-sliced the waiter ignored my inquiry and returned to the kitchen. Not only was there no natural juice on my plate because I didn't cut into it myself, the steak was as tough as leather.Overall the food wasn't as bad as the service but I wouldn't return for either.\", 'Fantastic experience, lovely steak, served on hot stones which means you get each mouthful cooked and hot just the way you like it.

We dined there in October 2018 and it is now inedible. The lady who used to be there and was friendly and lovely is no longer there, so perhaps ownership has changed. It explains why the food is now disgusting and the service rude. We ordered naan, lamb biryani, dal makhni, chicken tikka masala, raita, and a veg curry. The naan, chicken tikka masala, and dal makhni all had sugar added to them...why? The dal makhni was cooked with the wrong lentils and the chicken tikka masala was too sweet to eat. In fairness, the meat was tender, so the rave reviews on the site might be from patrons who chose to have grilled dishes and not curries. I was very disappointed by this place and even more disappointed by what I think are sponsored reviews on this site. I suspect the reviewers are receiving some sort of incentive for posting such positive reviews.', 'I did a lot of research prior to making reservations and coming here for a birthday dinner. We go to steakhouses several times a year and have been to many all across the country - this was BY FAR the worst experience we have had.First off, lets talk service. Our Server, Billy, was horrible. He was rude, grumpy, did not did not explain anything on the menu, and did not acknowledge the birthday dinner at all. The only reason I even know his name is because of the name on the receipt. All he cared about was whether or not we were going to order drinks. We wanted to wait and order the food first since that takes more time, but he assumed we weren\\'t drinking (even though we told him we would order drinks after we put in our food order), he angrily picked up the drink list, literally dismissed us with his hands, and stormed off. Sooo, no drinks for us,I guess? It was completely uncomfortable and tense. It was clear all he cared about was us spending money on drinks so the check was higher. Disgusting.Then the food came. First the apps. The Canadian bacon was good. Skip the fries. They are cold and overcooked. Our server quickly came by to ask how the apps were and then we didnt see him for the rest of the night.The entrees and sides came next. The sides, even though they were served in cast iron pans, were COLD. Like they were cooked long before the steak was done and just sat there. We ordered the mashed potatoes, crispy fingerling potatoes, glazed carrots, asparagus, and the mushrooms. The carrots were cold, gross and under cooked, mushrooms were cold, soggy, and bland, asparagus was bland and the \"bearnaise\" sauce that came along with it was cold, clumpy, and fake-tasting. The mashed potatoes and crispy potatoes were okay, so if you HAVE to go to this place, those sides are good.Now, the steak. We ordered the Ribeye, medium rare. Ribeyes are typically a cut with a ton of marbling, juices, and flavor. Out came this huge ribeye which we thought would salvage the night and be a showstopper. Then we took a bite. It was bland and SO BEYOND DRY. Despite the burned char on the outside, the color was beautiful on the inside. But it tasted awful and was anything but juicy when you ate it. We were perplexed. All you could taste was the burned char on the outside. Total Fail. We would have told our server about the issues with the food, but we never saw him again except for the very end of the night when he quickly dropped the check, told us to have a great night (this time with a little bit of enthusiasm in the hopes of a good tip) and ran off before we could even look up.We payed the check and left, deciding to just call management about this later. We called that night asking for a manager, were put on hold, and then told \"sorry the ,manager is busy tonight.\" WHAT?? Too busy to hop on the phone and talk to paying customer for 5 minutes? The next business day I called and left a detailed message with the hostess, explaining to her all that happened during our dinner. She pretended to care and we were told that the manager would call us back immediately. 2 days later, no call. Typical.Basically, if you love nice steak houses and want to treat yourself to a nice night, go somewhere else. ANYWHERE else. The food and service here is horrible and a company who treats (extremely nice and easy) customers like this is not worth my money or anyone else\\'s.TLDR: Skip it. Food is Bad. Service is Bad. Go somewhere else.', \"Decent enough restaurant, friendly waiting staff but the music was so loud I could not hear the person sat across from me. When I asked the staff to turn the music down they said they would see what they could do. It was not turned down and it really spoilt our experience.

Won't be back.\", 'I was so excited to try the steak after few recommendations from friends. We ordered a starter each and a steak. It took them 20 minutes to get the starters which was fine with us as we were enjoying a bottle of an Italian motepulciano.

The shrimp scampi was rubbery, and the shrimp Alfredo was bland with clumpy, sticky noodles and rubbery shrimp.Red Lobster meals are clearly overpriced for the quality you get. The best thing about this meal was the garlic, cheese, biscuits; they were actually better than the last Red Lobster visit in another state.

Definitely give it a go when around, won't regret!\", 'We’re not local to Manchester so we looked for a good place for sushi on Tripadvisor so visited Samsi on the strength of the reviews and raved longevity. The sushi we ordered came first and was ok, the salmon wasn’t the freshest we’ve ever had but nothing to complain about.The reason to give such a low review is that there was a table just parallel from us (baring in mind we were the only two tables in the restaurant at this time). The table in front had their bentos a good 5 minutes before the waitress goes to their table and asks the customer to swap her bento as it’s the wrong one. The customer then said it was ok, that she’d just keep that one as she’d already eaten from it. The waitress continued to persist to swap it and after she refused several times the waitress insisted she swap because it was ‘someone else’s order’ (so ours).Low and behold after successfully swapping, our bentos arrived seconds after. As someone who has their own restaurant I was quite put off by this. However I did not want to confront the staff at the time as all they could do was deny it or to waste the food and make a fresh one. Although a lot ended up going to waste anyways as I just picked at it.The bentos again were ok, the salmon on both our bentos was dry not the best we’ve ever had.Would have left 0 stars but leaving 2 stars as the waitress was actually really nice and friendly. Thank you for your service. But won’t be back.', 'My friend and I enjoyed a delicious meal here. The waiter Rahul was extremely friendly and helpful with what to select on the menu.

This is the best duck our family has ever tried and we also tasted some other local Beijing cuisines. I would recommend to try this place, especially if your from out of town.

The culture and traditional open fire, with the ducks cooking makes this a great experience.', 'Service was slow, awful, and you had to ask for everything.', 'A nice room with a good location but the cakes were dry and rather tasteless and they only sold the large buns in quarters, which was quite disappointing for parts of our party.', 'The food and wine were excellent.

Once again the review didn't steer us wrong. The cappuccino is always my beverage of choice when I rate different establishments. Cafe Husaren is definitely in the top 3 cappuccinos outside of Italy. We weren't very hungry after dinner, but the desserts are way too tempting and unique. Such a variety of cookies, squares, muffins and anything you can really imagine for a bakery/cafe. The service was great, the girl at the cash served us in English and very friendly as we have come to find with all Swedes.Cappuccino tasted great and I selected a White Chocolate cookie, that was about 8 inches round. That is not an exaggeration. All five of us picked different desserts from a Lemon Bar, which was served with fresh fruit and whipped cream to other unique squares and cookies.We sat at a table on the sidewalk and enjoyed the quiet area.

The ambience is luscious with industry chique combined, the restrooms want to give the impression of a run down place and succeed only half way. The service was a poor excuse for a service.

The side-salad with the steak was fridge-cold, mainly lettuce and you had to look hard for the dressing, the fries were pale and way to salty and the steak itself was just average.

I was sick for 2 1/2 days afterwards.', \"We decided to try this after a recommendation, but left bitterly disappointed. After the climb up the hill and numerous steps (extra hard as I'm pregnant), we were greeted with a great view from the restaurant and a complete let down in everything else. Very limited choice of about 8 main dishes, none less than 18 euros, none of which was a local or authentic dish. We were greeted by a moody waitress who didn't even say hello and just dumped the menus down on the table, before walking off to sit down on another table with her back to the restaurant. After an unacceptable length of time waiting for her to simply take our drinks order before we decided on the food, my partner and I eventually just got up and left. It was mid-week, not even busy (only 2 other tables occupied) so we find no excuse for this at all. We heard from a reliable local source the restaurant has been up for sale 3 years in a row without success...we can now see exactly why!

Me and my fiancée have been going to Gallagher’s for years to celebrate birthdays but I wanted to try something new this year. This place DID NOT disappoint. The restaurant is beautifully decorated for the holidays both outside and inside. The atmosphere inside is elegant, classy, and warm, everything a good restaurant should be. Beautiful and carefully considered ambience, especially to enjoy a night out in NYC during the holiday season. We were seated and our waiter, Nick, was so attentive and warm. He was really honest about how much he thought we should order and his suggestions were perfect. There are so many generous touches that undoubtedly makes this place the best dining experience I’ve had in NYC (I’ve lived here for 25 years). They brought out complimentary ravioli which was SO GOOD (even 2/3 of us who hate ravioli licked the plate clean). They finished off the night giving us a free dessert platter and let me tell you, this dessert wasn’t just a plate of stale assorted pastries they had to get rid of. Everything on the plate was absolutely delicious, some of the best dessert I have ever had. The owner,Bruno, was so attentive and lovely. He took it upon himself to make sure everyone was having a good evening and checked in with care and warmth. All our food was delicious, steaks were cooked EXACTLY as we had asked, seared perfectly, perfect temperature, perfect seasoning. The sides were also delicious. We couldn’t believe the generosity and hospitality but I expect no less from my Albanian compatriots. Best night out we’ve had in a long time.', \"Very poor food, very disappointing standard.

The menu sounded appetising and interesting and took a while to make my final choice. A disappointment after such anticipation! I think the meal could have been good but for some reason there was absolutely no noticeable seasoning or flavouring and tofu needs something. I could have added salt but I felt it needed more than that.

And I sure as heck didn't enjoy getting pushed to leave (can I take your plate?) while we were still finishing up. We were outta there in less than an hour, with a big bill, and it would have been more like 40 minutes if we hadn't lingered for a few minutes at the end. It's too commercial.

Today we would have a sandwich heated and the rest of the food cold. I remember that it takes time to heat the sandwich so I asked them to put it in immediately. It did not work! We would wait until we arrived and then they put it in. The rest of us had time to eat before it arrived! There is a lack of flexibility and an eye for what customers need.

Unfortunately mussels is not part of the lunch menu which my husband was craving after having had tasted mine. We were a group of 6 now. They offered a brunch menu.

Our starters (halloumi & dough balls) were good, but we ended up having to wait an hour for our main courses whilst other guests who had arrived after us got their meals quickly. When our mains did arrive they were disappointing - I had the Signature Burger which was 80% cheese and 20% burger (the burger itself was also over cooked) and my wife’s fish was overly greasy. We also witnessed one of the waitresses drop an onion chutney on a guest’s foot, completely ruining her new white trainers and failed to do anything about it! Personally we wouldn’t recommend.', \"The service here was horrible. We were seated pretty quickly after having been told it would be a 25 minute wait. They forgot the silverware and brought our appetizer without any napkins or silverware. Had to get up to ask for napkins. Brought out salads and had to ask for silverware to eat the salads with. The caesar salads came with a half ton of cheese on top - seemed like a cheese salad with some lettuce thrown in. Two people in our party ordered some sort of shrimp, both of which had completely different descriptions in the menu, but both of us received the same shrimp. When I ordered my shrimp item the server acted like she had never even heard of it before, had to point to it on the menu. When it came it was NOT what the menu said, just the same shrimp as the other person who ordered shrimp, and it came without some of the sides it was supposed to come with. I didn't bother complaining because it took long enough to get that food and the server didn't even seem to know the menu anyway.I've read an article about how millennials are killing sit-down restaurants... it's not the millennials, it's the crappy service, high prices, and low quality food. If I'm paying $100 for a meal, I at least expect decent service and the food that I actually ordered. I think I won't be visiting ANY Red Lobster anymore, and possibly ANY sit down restaurant. It's sad that before long there won't be any restaurants like this anymore, but there is definitely a reason why.\", 'Worst experience here. Waiter rude, not responding. Good tasteless.

I’m a big fan of Middle Eastern food, so was looking forward to going here. To be fair, the food was nice. Not amazing. Just nice. It was the other elements that let the place down. The staff were also nice, although some were clearly inexperienced (one beef dish, was described as tuna), which made the service feel a bit amateur. We ordered the Fork tasting menu, of which some items we had to ask for (feta and grapes only arrived at the end of the meal when prompted) and other items (such as the olives) didn’t arrive at all. We were later told it was a choice of one or the other of these. Which seemed odd, and was different to what we were told at the start. As for the venue, we sat upstairs which had overly fierce air con. And as many people have commented, the place has loud hi-energy music that felt at odds with the restaurant. To add insult to injury, when the bill arrived, we noticed that we’d been overcharged. Whilst it was corrected, it wasn’t done in a particularly apologetic way and we had to point out the price shown on the menu. Which just felt a bit embarrassing.

In short, silver skin should be removed from a steak prior to cooking because silver skin doesn't break down. Instead it becomes very tough and chewy. Further, trying to remove silver skin after a steak has been cooked is challenging (especially with their un-serrated steak knives).

I opted for the fresh catch of the day, Mahi Mahi at $20.99 and a Sam Adams beer at $6.98. The others placed their orders and the cheesy biscuits arrived shortly after. We munched on them for a while and waited for our main courses. The kids were getting ansi as time ticked by. Eventually they were brought to our table and everyone tucked in. I couldn't help notice (to my disappointment) that my piece of fish was smaller than my cell phone. The rest of my plate, about two thirds, was covered in fries. I wanted to bring up the issue to our waitress but she had disappeared. I was the first to finish. Don't get me wrong, the Mahi was nice, but no where near value for money. I didn't want to make a fuss because the others looked satisfied with their meals. So when we were ready to leave after paying the $133 bill (plus 18% tip) I asked the waitress to put us a few of those cheesy biscuits in a bag to go, and I would state my concern about the miniscule portion on her return. Thing is, she never did return. While the rest of our party were making their way to the car park I asked the host where our waitress had gone. She didn't know.

I have to say the food is not great, burnt over cooked and generally not nice. Half of the food didn't turn up because the waitress forgot to order it (always a bad sign when the waitress does not have a pad to take down the order). The drinks were weak and had far too much ice in them. This place has a lot to improve if it expects to stay around. At the moment avoid at all costs.\", 'Sitting at the restaurant writing this. I hate giving one star reviews. Something really has to ruin my experience for me to do so. All I can say is, vegans and vegetarians, do not come here. You will not feel welcome.  As a Vegas local, I have been coming to Mon Ami Gabi for a long time, and it has really declined in quality. As anyone who has dined here will know, they have a relatively small menu with extremely limited options for vegans and vegetarians. You\\'re pretty much relegated to eating the baguettes and garlic spinach, which are delicious, but not a full meal. I had heard of a new vegan menu that the restaurant had debuted, and was extremely excited to try it.  When we arrived, I asked for the vegan menu and was immediately told \"we don\\'t have it anymore\". I wondered if there was some miscommunication, asked if they had any vegan options, and received a curt \"no\". This essentially created a situation where I couldn\\'t eat anything on the small menu. The server was extremely rude- did not explain why, and did not offer any alternate options that I could eat on the main menu. I was honestly taken aback at this treatment.  I was pretty patient up to this point and tried to explain nicely that I am vegan and invited my group to Mon Ami due to the vegan menu, and asked if there was anything they could do so our entire party would not have to leave the restaurant. I was told by the server, with a disrespectful and unprofessional attitude like I was an idiot, that the vegan menu was discontinued due to covid. The server said they could offer us a veggie platter. Again, an app- NOT A MEAL. It seems like Mon Ami Gabi has continued the trend of restaurants using covid as an excuse to give diners poor service and a complete lack of accommodation for dietary choices that are beyond the standard in Vegas, which has turned into something of a vegan paradise. Another example is that they are now charging for small table baguettes, which were previously complimentary with the meal, huge, and delicious.  At this point I was pretty ticked off at the terrible service- tell me the vegan menu is discontinued, but since that was the only reason we were dining here, at least treat me like a human and offer me some options I can eat! We requested management. The only saving grace was the manager, who was extremely kind and offered to talk to the chef to help us get some of the menu items made vegan. But at this point the damage is done; not happy at all and the experience here has really been soured for me. I would really hesitate to return when there are so many excellent dining options for vegans in Vegas.  If you are vegan or vegetarian, do not come here expecting to be accommodated. You will not be treated well at all. Go elsewhere on or off Strip where there are plenty of unbelievable restaurant options that not only will accommodate your dietary choices, but you will leave with a fulfilling meal and service experience.', 'Service was fantastic and the food was really good. Would go back again and would highly recommend to others. It is quite small inside the restaurant but there is a good vibe and kind staff.', \"We were given an allergy menu and they were aware of my daughter's allergy when we arrived. We were asked if we wanted to see the chef but since my daughter found something she liked on the allergy menu we did not request seeing the chef. My daughter ordered grilled shrimp skewer with brown rice and vegetables. We asked for vanilla soy milk and our waitress was not sure if she had it but said she would ask. They did have it which was nice. The meal my daughter received was safe and free of her allergens but seriously lacked any flavor or taste. It was horrible, but my daughter was a trooper and ate it. I mentioned to the waitress that I was grateful that the meal was safe but that it lacked taste and flavoring. She said that because it was an allergy meal no seasoning was put on anything. It was dry plain shrimp, plain rice, and vegetables. If I ever eat here again I will ask to speak to the chef so that I can determine how things will be prepared. \", \"Absolutely love it here. The staff are so nice and friendly and the decor and atmosphere make it really romantic and cosy. The food and drinks are fab, although I would say it's more of a main course kind of place as the desserts are quite limited.

Food average but made up by amazing cocktails and most importantly brilliant staff!', 'The one thing I’ve never expected to criticise an Indian restaurant for is its service.

Very good pasta especially seafood linguini.', 'Our first Sunday at the resort thought we’d try it but there was a huge queue-says it all really! Found another good place and returned to Ayo the following week. Cracking paella and couldn’t believe that people were allowed to go back for second helpings, and all for 8 euros. Also had a pork dish that was basically like a hot pot but with pork not lamb-also very tasty. Easy to see why this place is packed even ‘off-season’.', 'Fantastic spot for a quick business supper during the week. A good atmosphere and friendly staff make this place incredibly welcoming.I travel a lot for work and it’s great to be back on the road, but places like this help you to feel a little welcome and homely when far away from the real thing.Eastern Eye do the basics fantastically well. On top of a generally very tasty meal, possibly the best garlic naan bread and mango chutney I have had for a long time.', 'We had a lovely time at Andy’s Taverna, the service was exceptional.

Added to that, the taste of food for the same items went down on successive courses. The most pinnacle of meal was when we had to wait for 20mins for our water refill. Some hotels either give good tastey food even it takes time to prepare and others serve decent food at quicker time but here both time and taste of food prepared is poor.', \"The food was great and the ambience with the view was excellent!!

The Chili Chicken garlic main at over £12 was the smallest portion I’ve ever seen and the hygiene is highly questionable! Storing poppadoms in a dirty looking cupboard at the back of a room is hardly hygienic to me! As is re-using onion salads etc all night which I witnessed! These people are just con artists that serve small portions screw you on the ‘little extras’ and the whole reason why the curry houses in Brick Lane struggle!

This is not the case with this restaurant.My friend and I went as a last meal in New York before leaving the city and wanted an excellent meal to end a wonderful trip. This was not what we expected.Starting with the salad, listed as a mixed greens salad with no further description the salad came with roquefort cheese, while this is not the end of the world, it would have been nice to know that they put it on the salad so to know to ask to hold it.Next the meal. We both ordered the Filet Mignon, she medium well, I medium rare. Sides? Broccoli and fries. I asked the waiter what the process was for the sautéed broccoli. He said olive oil and garlic. Great. ((I should mention I have a severe nut allergy)The sides and steak arrive. Her steak, EXTREMELY overcooked, not slightly, very. The waiter was very gracious and offered to take hers back. Then my steak, medium rare is the recommended way to order a steak. Medium rare usually entails tender meat, pink to red with blood and tender to cut. My steak was dry, parts were well done other medium, no blood and difficult to cut. I hate to send things back and so didn't but needless to say worst prepared steak I've had in a long time.The sides. The fries were excellent! The broccoli came out with a dressing of pine nuts (remember the allergy?) I asked because I wanted to avoid this happening and the waiter never mentioned anything about pine nuts. So I had to send it back.Now we've sent the broccoli back, her steak back and so are eating the fries and waiting for her steak to arrive. The sides cool, my steak cools, the new broccoli cools and finally her steak arrives. This cut looking suspiciously unlike a filet mignon and once again over cooked, at this point though we've given up hope and suck it up and eat our steaks. Hers overcooked, mine overcooked and cold.To make it up to us they brought a complimentary dessert - our advice? Avoid the cheesecake and the tiramisu.So can you really call yourself a steakhouse when you can't prepare a steak? You tell me.\", 'two slices of barely warmed up pizza and a small soda for almost $9.00 . On a Thursday afternoon around 2:00 PM. UGH! Terrible.

When we arrived, the greeter was polite but not warm and she showed us to a table where the chair was literally touching another chair occupied by one of only three other groups in the restaurant at the time. There were ten tables for two on the upper floor, of which nine were empty and despite this, our request to be seated at a different one was refused by the greeter who said that every table was scheduled for a specific time and she couldn’t possibly change our table in the nearly empty restaurant. I sat down feeling uncomfortable, practically touching the other party and when our waiter, Sam, came over with water he immediately allowed us to move to a different table. He continued to show warm, personable and efficient service throughout our meal which was the antithesis of the poor, inflexible service shown by his colleague. The food was delicious, high quality and flavoursome with high end prices. We chose the Festive Menu which was a great combination of dishes although the babka was a bit of a heavy dessert to finish the meal on. We ordered a jug of gazoz which was sickly sweet and didn’t seem to contain much vodka. The 12.5% service charge added a significant amount to our bill but given Sam’s excellent service it was palatable. Tables are tightly packed in the restaurant so probably not for you if you are concerned about social distancing. The music is loud to the point that we couldn’t hear what some of the dishes were when they were brought to our table. To summarise, although the food was good and waiter service excellent, there are restaurants with more relaxing and spacious environments in this price range and certainly that will not hesitate to allow me a choice of where I am seated.

The starters arrived relatively promptly and after that everything went downhill. The service was appalling - no-one took the slightest notice of us. I had to get up and find a waiter at least 5 times. We had to wait over an hour and a half for our main course and when it arrived it was luke warm. The vegetarian option was just a bowl of sloppy vegetables and some rice. Our plates weren't cleared after our starters - we asked twice for the table to be cleaned and a very charming but incompetent young waitress took away one plate and then served another table. We felt like we were invisible and there was no excuse for such bad service - we arrived early when the restaurant was virtually empty so we could easily have been served our starters and then our main course, and after that we would have gone home happy.

Views are ok but larger parties will be in the central booths that don’t give you much of a feel for it, and on one side the view is obscured by the roof and a window cleaning crane. Vegetarian tacos and sushi were good quality made with fresh ingredients, but nothing extra special. Black cod portion was generous, as were the chops, both were very tasty. Service however was very poor, especially for the standard you imagine they are trying to set. I don’t mind restaurants that bake a service charge into the bill but then you have to be absolutely on point, whereas at SushiSamba this seems to be a reason not to try very hard. Our initial waiter vanished after getting us some water, leading to several later tables getting their order taken ahead of us. Subsequently we had to send some food back because it had not been made without mayonnaise as requested when ordered. I would expect the order to be checked before being delivered to the table, what made it much worse was that when we made the waiting staff who had brought the food aware of the problem, the food was just left there until we told “our” waiter.

However, once we were finished eating and received the bill I noticed she charged us $37.99 instead of $33.99 listed on the promo. Therefore we requested to physically see the paper with the promo. Now all of a sudden they were out of the papers and they wouldn’t honor the price that was listed that she claimed they would prior to us ordering. Then Mgr. Kat came out and basically said that he couldn’t honor the price claiming market value prices had increased in just one week and there’s nothing that he could do. Even though we were just at their other location where the price was actually $31.99. To add insult to injury another guy named Cody came over to our table and basically tried to loud talk us and embarrass us in front of all the other customers with a card with corporate number after I explained to Kat that I didn’t need the number and I had already located the number online. At that point, I felt as though they were being racist and tried to belittle and degrade both my mom and I in front of the rest of their customers. Because I couldn’t honestly see them doing this to any other customers in the restaurant. Additionally, Kat walked passed my mom and I to greet other patrons on several occasions without saying a word to us. I felt after he noticed that we were looking at him, he finally decided to at least say hi. In addition, after I told them it was fine, they basically kept trying to insult us in front of other people by loud talking us, until my mom basically got up and walked out from being embarrassed. At that point, were extremely humiliated with what we thought would be an enjoyable experience, but turned out to be a nightmare. For reasons that, we had driven so far to come to that location, and it basically turned out to be an awful experience. With all that said, I ended up tipping our waitress 20%, because she was a good waitress other than giving us false information regarding pricing, plus we are business owners ourselves and we understand the importance of tipping when necessary. However the management there was awful with how they handled the overall situation. FYI, honestly at that point it really wasn't about the price, it was about the fact that they purposely tried to humiliate us in front of everyone else as if we were trying to get something for free. We merely wanted them to honor what they initially told to us, yet they refused and tried to embarrass us in the process. Very disgusting and awful practices. Never will we visit another Red Lobster.\", \"I went here with two of my girlfriends. We ordered many items and everything was top notch..and we have discerning tastes.

We are total foodies and were so excited for Club A Steakhouse. I always do my research before we head to a restaurant, and after all the excellent reviews, my expectations were high. I called to confirm our reservation and the woman who answered was very nice, which boded well. We entered the restaurant and were greeted by the host, who was also friendly, and offered to take our coats. So far so good. We were led to a table upstairs. I had read that the main dining room was more beautiful, but we were there for the food, so no big deal. Within moments of being seated we were presented with menus and asked if we would like to see a wine list. We didn\\'t order wine, but immediately ordered an appetizer of crab cakes. They came out quickly and were pretty average. I\\'m from Maryland, so my standards are high, but I\\'ve had better crab cakes at just about every other high end steak house I\\'ve visited. We were really there for the steak so we remained hopeful. I ordered a filet medium-rare, and he ordered his medium. We also ordered sides of whipped potatoes and macaroni and cheese. The steaks took a long time but thankfully we weren\\'t in a hurry. After they arrived, we realized my boyfriend\\'s sauce was wrong. No waiter was in sight, so we cut into our steaks. My filet was cooked medium, pink throughout with gray edges, which wasn\\'t what I wanted. The texture was dry. There was none of the silky tenderness you expect in a good filet. It just tasted overcooked, but I was so hungry I just decided to go ahead and eat it. My boyfriend\\'s filet was the real issue. He ordered it medium and calling it medium well was generous, as it was basically gray with just a thin streak of pink on the inside. The side dishes were also a disaster. The whipped potatoes looked like a gooey scoop of vanilla ice cream. The macaroni and cheese was so unappetizing that my boyfriend took one bite before giving up in disgust. He described it as clumps of cheese with bland elbow macaroni noodles, some of which weren\\'t even coated with cheese at all. We waited for at least ten minutes before anyone came over. Finally a different waiter appeared, and we stopped him out of desperation, at which point we requested the correct sauce and also showed him my boyfriend\\'s filet. \"This is a little overcooked for me. This was requested medium.\" The waiter took the plate and held it to the lit candle on our table. \"That is medium,\" he said, nodding confidently, \"But I\\'ll take it back to the kitchen to find out.\" To find out what? Either he doesn\\'t know what medium looks like, which is hard to believe about a waiter in a steakhouse, or he thought we didn\\'t know and therefore didn\\'t acknowledge their error. After a while, our original waiter returned and apologized, asking if my boyfriend wanted another filet. By that time, we\\'d been waiting so long, neither of us was even hungry anymore. We declined and asked for the check. 10+ minutes passed without any further acknowledgement. Finally another waiter came and set a complimentary dessert in front of is. No check. We sat and watched the plate of melty ice cream for about five minutes, until my boyfriend was basically seething. A waiter walked by and my boyfriend flagged him down and asked for the check. Finally they brought it out. My boyfriend\\'s filet and the whipped potatoes we\\'d ordered were comped (presumably because we\\'d barely touched them- they never actually asked why we hadn\\'t eaten them). At no point did a manager come to our table, at no point did anyone show any level of customer service you\\'d expect at a restaurant at this price point. As I mentioned, our original waiter did apologize, but only after we\\'d had to flag someone else down to show them the improper cook on the steak. I\\'ve had better service . . . . pretty much everywhere. Never again!', 'Barista had an aloof attitude and was not helpful at all when I asked about options for tea.

Sadly, the reality has left a rather bad taste in the mouth. At $100 a head (not including taxes, service or drinks) expectations were high. At this price, one expects a highly attentive service with exceptional food. Neither were present. The waiter was frosty from the start and though the lobster bisque as a starter was a delight, the rest was not. The filet steak was over cooked (I had asked for medium rare). There was no sauce with the main. Unless you class a blob of Tomato ketchup in a dish as a sauce. The sides were tasteless and bland. Not once were we asked how the food was. They had ran out of the wine we wanted and the waiter seemed uninterested to recommend other choices. At the end of the meal, whilst we still had unfinished dessert plates on our table the waiter just dropped the bill on the table without us even having asked for it. What about coffee or a nice aperitif? Chance would be a fine thing! Clearly they wanted the table back as quick as possible. To top it all off, a young women was going round all the 'heterosexual' tables during their desserts, wishing them a happy valentines and offering a complimentary photo of the couples as a keepsake. Which seemed a really nice touch. Were we offered this? Again, chance would be a fine thing! Another gay couple opposite were also ignored. In the end we could not wait to get out having felt let down throughout the evening. A disappointing night.\", 'Really nice gem tucked away in the leafy suburb of Chorlton.

I wound up feeling sick the rest of the day after that meal, seemingly from minor contamination enough to cause a minor reaction but not send me into anaphylactic shock. Thank God it wasn't more than that. My mother had the same problem as me, and considering she shares an allergy to walnuts, it seems this was likely the culprit.

We walked in, asked to sit outside and it was as if I had done something terrible. She looked me up and down and asked me to repeat myself. We then got seated outside and we’re waiting 25 minutes without getting served so naturally I headed inside to ask could we please order. I couldn’t have been more polite when asking and the same girl again looked me up and down and made me repeat myself twice. She then nothing short of glared at me and said she’d send someone out.

I explained the situation and told him how disappointed of whee he put us and he moved us out of the main dining room and sat us in a corner, much quieter. Leonard took care of us from there, but our original waiter came to check on us many times, along with giving us recommendations of the menu.

There is pleanty of other and better burger options in town especially in this price range -a burger costs 14 bucks, fries or garnish excluded. The only positive experience about the 5 Napkins was a nice table service.', 'Positioned in the center of Cannes near Palais de Festival New York, New York is good place for fast break for lunch during the festival or busy day when you want to eat decent but not spend much and not to spend too long. Internet WiFi is good what is for Cannes rare.', 'Excellent service and food. Difficult to get a table as there is limited seating with an open kitchen. The wine is kinda expensive with Aussie Wines on the list.

After receiving the chicken and rice, I had a hard time swallowing a poached slime like chicken with skin that was like flesh. I think that the desire was for quantity and not quality here.

The pizza is delicious (the Giambotta is a bit spicy, my head was sweating.) We went around 4:30 to avoid the rush and it was a great time to go.

You want fish to be HOT unless it is a cold dish. Ours weren't. The bartender Tony was the best part of the evening. Friendly, helpful and efficient. The wait staff had a bit of a lackadaisical attitude.... so what if your meal isn't hot!! The Cod was good when it was served hot as were the green beans and the sweet potatoe. The Yellow Fin Tuna which was supposed to be seared and rare, came out gray and had about a dime diameter of pink in the middle (and was cold)... so this was a huge disappointment. We would not recommend this restaurant - it operates like a factory.\", 'For £30 (lunch, including service tax), the foods were nothing special. Average at best. Lacks of variety.

My guests seem to enjoy their whole bass, which they shared....along with several vegetables and salad. I opted for the Daily Special Halibut. However, I didn\\'t realize it was covered in bread crumbs and more than quite dry. In addition, the \"roasted brussel sprouts\", were more like fried and dried brussel spouts.

Would love to come again!', 'This was my 2nd visit. 1st one was great. This one wasn’t sadly. In summary, contacting them via phone was awful. When I eventually did get through, the message wasn’t passed on. Service staff were incredibly rude and not understanding at all. Drinks, forgotten, food came out after an hour and a half. Booted off our table just after 2 hours and then they had the cheek to argue when we asked not to pay service. Throughly disappointed that the first get together after lockdown ended up here and ended like this.', 'I can’t say anything negative about the place. The problem is I can’t say much good either. The food just doesn’t taste much. And given the price and the supposed fine cuisine it just wasn’t worth it.

The place is nice, the cocktails are nice however the food is a real disappointment. My friend ordered the calamari but it was like rubber the dough balls were dry and the Humus was tasteless. The mains were an even bigger disappointment dry Pizzas, chips that are advertised as chunky chips were nothing more than frozen average sized chips that you would pick up in a super market freezer. The burger, I had to send back as it was very pink when I cut into it. I was then told that the pink was an ingredient they use in the burger. Maybe they could advise customers of this prior. Not very appealing. The burger bun was soggy so unfortunately I didn't eat it. Such a shame as the place itself is lovely.

My husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon in August, around 2pm. Right away, things were strange. The manager (we assumed) was standing right inside the front doorway having a somewhat heated discussion with one of the kitchen staff. We stood there awkwardly for a few minutes, but neither made a move to stop, or even to slide over so we could get through.  The 2 baristas behind the front counter were just staring at the discussion -- none of the 4 staff members made a move to welcome us, or guide us to the dining seating or ask what we might want at the counter.  We didn't know what to do, and since we had never been there, didn't know where to stand or how to get seated. We awkwardly pushed past the manager and the kitchen staff person and then stood in the dining area. Still, no one said anything to us. A long pause later, the manager finally broke away to ask us if we wanted to sit down. Actually, we didn't -- we wanted to order at the counter but didn't realize that was an option since it was blocked when we entered.  Long story short we ended up ordering 2 coffee drinks and 2 pastries at the counter but the baristas were quite unfriendly and unhelpful. The food and drinks were great, but this has turned me off from ever going to Maman again -- at least not to this location.\", \"We had to wait a couple of minutes before they let us in, they keep the interior free from any crowding. Service was quick and very kind.

The starter / first course was very good, so was the main course, then it took about 45mins for the (very small) desert to arrive. Meanwhile a third couple had arrived and their desert was served just after ours, I looked at it and pointed out to my friend that theirs was 3 times the size of ours, we put this down to us having ordered the set-menu which is less expensive. But unfortunately we did not realize until we had left that we were in fact charged the full menu prices for everything instead of the set-menu price.

The main courses took well over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. Cleanliness 1/6: It’s not a very clean place. There were acutal cobwebs in the celling.

It wasn’t busy, a few others were eating and drinking but try as we may just couldn’t get anyone’s attention. Finally someone came over but all they did was move the umbrella so that we were now in the hot sun. Just odd.', 'I had a business lunch and the Cod was not cooked well. The service is slow and forget to give the full course. The cooked dishes such as scrambled eggs and tomatoes are terrible. You would get a better prisoners breakfast. The cheese was also moldy and dry for 2 days. I know they do not want eastern food. But please try and make it fresh to a certain level.', 'What a place and story! What a building. I think the most remarkable restaurants in Madrid. Congratulations for keeping this tradition so many years. Will definitely visit again. Thank you.', 'This restaurant was hailed as the highlight of our trip. How wrong could you be? We accidentally stumbled into a smoke-filled room with some drunken guests doing Karaoke.When we got to the restaurant itself it overlooked a swimming pool for diplomats in strange swimming costumes. When the menu arrived it seemed to have every cuisine imaginable and the guides and driver were keen to have anything non-Korean. The sushi ordered looked fine but we stayed with the Korean food which, having had many good meals during our trip, was disappointing. The venue afforded an insight into the life of diplomats in the area but not an insight into the every day life of the normal people who live there.', \"Over rated. And because of this it is always packed. Can't get in, and frankly I would not want to.

The server wrote down all of our allergies and immediately spoke with the manager and chef. She walked us through the menu pointing out safe options and ways to make certain menu items safe. You could tell she had done this before many times... She assured us that they are used to it. We were able to order a safe version of the guacamole (without the cheese) and several tacos for the kids and they loved them! We felt welcome, valued, and comfortable. We will definitely be back!', 'Waste of money. Less items in buffet. Taste was too bad. The prices are just to enter inside ITC.', \"It was a restaurant situated in the basement, very little ventilation so a very interesting choice to serve sizzling platters so we choked on other people's food. Food was absolutely awful, the chicken korma was yellow and the rice was bland. Lamb Karahi was no good as well and even with 50% off the food was bad value. \", \"Was a great atmosphere very nice staff and good food. I read some reviews so far but I don't agree with the ones that say it was a bad experience mine was very good\", \"Busboys & Poets is a GREAT, hip, small chain in the DC area.

We had been here a few years ago and remembered it as the best steak we had ever had. We were in NYC for a weekend over my husband’s birthday! I booked a table immediately on Open Table. I mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating his birthday. We (family of 4, with 2 kids 8&10) were given a beautiful table, with a window view. Dinner was extraordinary. Calamari app was delicious. Steaks were cooked to perfection and sides were very generous. On top of a great meal, I felt like we (along with all the other patrons) were Bruno’s personal guests. Bruno, the owner, welcomed us on check in and made the rounds checking on each table several times throughout the evening. My children were treated with the utmost respect. And Since we were there for a special occasion, they brought us an extra treat before our steak and took our picture after dinner. Bruno brought the picture with a note thanking us for celebrating there. Clearly a 5 star dining experience! Highly recommend to anyone!', 'We came here on cruise. A lot of travel books, even TV program on cruise mention the wonderful giant Swedish cinnamon roll at this bakery. So we got off the ship and came here.The famous cinnamon roll is 8” round, size of a small pizza. They also come in a quarter size. My husband and I got one of the quarter cinnamon rolls, a cream bun and teas. They were both very dry, without much flavor.(Look at my photo, they looked dry!)While I was talking with my husband, the table next to us, there were four women (from the cruise too) sharing a giant cinnamon roll, overheard me then responded, “yes, it’s very dry, not good at all!”We were all very disappointed, unexpectedly.

I love the duck breast and their specialty food, Moroccan pastel! The staff are friendly and polite highly recommended!', 'I went dinner in this restaurant for a special occasion.

Waitress seemed happy to help. Drinks were delicious. Overall very pleased.', 'Visited here on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. In the UK the price of Haddock and Chips has not changed for years but they still make a profit because you are advised to bring your own magnifying glass to find the fish. Not so here, the portion was massive and almost hung off either side of the giant plate. The fish was coated in heavenly batter which was so crisp it was a delight to break in and find glorious white haddock perfectly cooked inside. Chips good also. In the UK we have \"mushy peas\" with our Haddock and Chips and this is made with Marrowfat Peas, but the tartar sauce was great and we had enough ketchup to use for a fake tan if we wanted. On our first visit we had a bottle of GRGICH HILLS ESTATE Sauvignon Blanc from the Napa Valley which would rival many Pouilly Fume wines from France. On our second visit our young server from Connecticut saw my fat wallet and recommended a Sancerre but I chose a Gruner Veltliner from Austria was both excellent and great value. I wish I lived in Boston and not CHILMARK Wiltshire in the UK. The people of Boston made us so welcome and we felt very at home here. Look forward to coming here again.', 'Awful food', 'Great atmosphere, food, and service.

It's very popular and the views are stunning, so waiting is not uncommon.  The wait estimates we were given were always reasonable and accurate. If anything the actual wait was a little shorter than the estimate. There are a lot of tables and the staff coordinate and communicate well with each other to turn over empty tables and get new customers seated. The service was quick and friendly, gave us considerate and insightful answers to all our questions, and both of our parties' special requests were handled without fuss or error. That's always a relief.There was usually live music being played when we were there.  pleasant sounding, and not too loud. you could still easily hold a conversation with somebody relatively close to you. I would have to raise my voice to talk to someone more than a couple steps away. so the music's prominently there, but not so much that it's difficult to talk if you're seated close to each other or with the wait staff.If you have a chance to sit along the outside perimeter of the restaurant, TAKE IT!!

The interior of the restaurant itself lacks atmosphere and is dominated by side tables full of crockery and the centrally positioned bar. Food on offer lacks any creativity and although my meal was well cooked the service was slow to the point of being non-existent. I was not offered a dessert choice when the table was cleared of main course crockery, nor asked if I wished for further drinks or coffee, although when I requested the bill, I was brought a beer by a member of staff who was not familiar with English.

My breakfast arrived and it must have been the worst scrambled eggs I have ever had. The plate had a lacklustre bundle of limp rocked chucked on my plate and the eggs tasted like plastic. They were so inedible I just ate the toast so I basically paid 7.99 for two slices of toast. They didn't even come with enough butter to put on them.

There were many items that took 20 minutes to come out and we were 45 minutes in to our 2 o'clock booking when we were told last orders. We actually ordered more food before we had finished the other set in hope we could actually get half our money's worth. I'd say of our entire orders, 20% of our dishes never arrived and all of them hot or fried. Its nice food, but the service, ordering style and wait just wasn't worth it. Also automatic service charge added. Most annoying thing is that they display coke in the glass bottles, but when you order its out of their tap and diluted to hell.

Saying that service was S-L-O-W would be an understatement. The waiter took easily 10-15 minutes before even coming to our table. We ordered a bottle of wine (all the tables around us were only having cocktails) - hence we thought we would have been given some extra attention. We were wrong. Our bottle of wine arrived when we were half through eating our steak. Hence pointless to have the wine, so we sent it back.

The cocktails and the prices are an absolute cheek. ', \"I'd give this restaurant a 3 star rating based on the food alone as it is very average. We went for menu 3, which seemed like a good idea to begin with, however the small dishes were average and the grilled meats were dry and you could tell they were prepared before hand. The dessert is poor, and I know for a fact you can get a much better Baklava at the Greek restaurant down the road (if you want Greek instead of Lebanese). The thing that brings the rating to 1 star is the service.

Once inside you discover it is not available for dinner. LEAVE AT THIS POINT AS WHAT FOLLOWS IS NOT WORTH IT. The smallest 8oz steak is £18 and there is a cover charge of £1pp in effect making the steak £19 as no bread was offered so the cover charge is just a price hike. The steak was ok but not great. There are no chips or sides with the order you have top pay another £2.50 for fries. Bad value for an undistinguished theatreland meal. Many better choices.', 'This place is renowned for its massive cinnamon buns, and it didn’t disappoint in that department – they were bigger than my face. Unfortunately the queues were horrendous. We were waiting for over half an hour as there only seemed to be one person serving, and when we did get our treats, we realised that they were just substandard cinnamon buns.

Very $$$$....didn’t mind the price if the food was good (good is average to me). I had the spaghetti with clams (Qty 4). The pasta was overcooked and drowned in butter. The microscopic clams mixed with the pasta tasted worse then canned. My husband had the Salmon he was unimpressed but hungry.

It sounds odd, but is true.We go inside, decor nothing interesting, just a place they call \"restaurant\" in America!My husband ordered something to drink - nothing special and it could serve 3 people. First advise: share dishes when in Orlando. Pick something both of you like and buy it. You will avoid paying more money and above all throwing away food. I\\'m not sure how much the American eat, but definitely differently from the European.I ordered fish and my husband one of their famous dishes. Again, I quite enjoyed my dish (please note the food presentation doesn\\'t really make you want to eat what you ordered) but it was ok, I didn\\'t feel sick- a bonus.

Many of the restaurants on brick lane have 'touts' outside offering various discounts to entice you in. This place seemed a good deal. The waiter seemed confused by our orders so I asked him to clarify what incorrectly. We still ended up with the wrong sides and he seemed loathed to take them back! The meat in our dishes had no flavour which suggest to me the sauces are cooked and then whatever meat requested is added. The dish isn't lacked depth of flavour, I would expect so much more from a restaurant which claims to be 'the best on Brick Lane'. When we came to pay the bill the promised discount had not been applied and the tout on the door said he could prove the offer had not been made by reviewing the cctv - I was happy to wait - however he then backtracked and said it would take too long. After much discussion our party agreed to split the difference.

However, when my husband and i took our foreign friends there 3 days ago, we were totally disappointed because the Peking Duck was too fatty, the dishes are too small-- e.g. the sweet and sour pork rib is as small as 1 to 2 sections of a finger and the meat is rough. The problem is that the dishes are tastless. U can feel that the chef doesn’t do it with heart. There is no decoration at all. We feel ASHAMED to bring friends there. It’s expensive and not worth it.

I ordered steak, it was dry and overcooked.', \"Service is fast and friendly. Our favorite thing were the oysters, 3 for $6 during happy hour! The poke was OK, maybe because we came at the end of the day so it didn't seem as fresh and the consistency of the fish was extremely mushy. We loved the squid salad! Slightly spicy with a nice bite to it. The beef rice bowls were decent, priced at $5.50 for one but they gave us some on the house since they were about to close. We ate them the next morning before hiking and it was tasty, though there was a lot of rice compared to meat. Overall a good experience and I'd come back earlier in the day to try their poke fresh!\", \"A but pricey but great for a honeymoon ar a special occasion.

Each dish was delicately crafted, full of flavour. Portions are generous to the point that I couldn't finish the whole course, but there is a lightness to their dishes so that you don't feel greasy or feel heavy from overeating.

Very bad for trying to copy a dish that has already been rated as street food in Mexico.', \"I was disappointed with both. The burger was soggy and NOT DONE. I asked for plain burger, got one with cheese. The shake looked good, but when it came it didn't look like the picture - no WHIP. I asked if whip came with it, and she said only if you ask. Why do you show the picture of a shake with WHIP if it doesn't come with it? On a scale of 1-10, it was a 2. Flavor-less, obviously made with chocolate ice cream (my pet peeve of shakes - it's a shortcut). So I would NOT go back.\", 'I think I caught this place on a bad day. We ate in a room with about 16 people. There was a fly that never left. Our waiter was bright, knowledgeable and seemed proud of his work. I ordered the hyped clam chowder. It seemed good, but it was cool and just not vey palatable. I felt ripped off because the ingredients were so good. The coffee was also very cool. Attention to all their food was not there. My cod meal was very good (and hot). Other folks seemed to like their meals, but all the chowder was cool. The deserts were very good. Good waiter and main course. Fly and cool food made it an overall off experience.', 'An exceptionally poor customer experience from the moment we walked in.

Only saving grace of the night was great waiter...Nick to which we tipped well but removed the service charge from the 600 pound bill.

He made sure we were comfortable and even moved us to a nicer table as soon as one was available. The food was delicious, the drinks were also wonderful.', \"Horrible. The worst Wendy's I've been to in years. It smells like frying, no air conditioning, cold sandwiches. Only french fries were ok\", \"Don't make the same mistake I did by seeing a large group of people in a restaurant to mean that the place must be good.

The atmosphere was gorgeous, the service impeccable the food phenomenal the table visits by Bruno the owner delightful and the music enjoyable. From start to finish we were treated like royalty and we appreciated all the extras that were bestowed upon us. If your looking for a classic piece of New York with live music and exquisite food and atmosphere look no further than Club A. Everything was fantastic from appetizer to dessert. We will be back. Thank you Bruno and staff.', \"Great restaurant, but god forbid you have a food intolerance, they won't accommodate even though the waiter asked us if we have any intolerances or allergies. My wife is also pregnant and wanted a mocktail, but they only have one choice which was a jalapeno infused drink, not ideal.

The menu is colossal and extremely expensive!!I realize that we are in Cannes but that is no excuse for poor ingredients and bad cooking. My spare ribs were inedible. The sides were bland. Wine list had on the first page bottles of wine that were the price of a car!!!Our waiter had no idea on how to clear a table I was still eating and my friend was cleared. Need I go on?

When we checked in at the restaurant we were told to wait inline and it would be a 30-45 minute wait. I asked to speak to a manger about this wait time when we had specific reservations, Michael the manager was extremely rude and argumentative, told us that the staff at Planet Hollywood lied to us about our reservations being seated outside. He continued to state that he really could care less that we were Diamond/VIP status and if we didn’t like it we could leave as their restaurant has no affiliation with Ceasars even though it rents the space at Paris Hotel and Casino. Micheal was so rude and yelling loudly, that Anthony the Materde came over and completely resolved the situation and provided us with first class customer service. Anthony is definitely a keeper. On the other hand Michael has no business managing people or customer service issues.

The hostess looked as us like we were stupid and asked “ya ready to order, or…?” We ordered and she continued to make snarky faces and act like a petulant teenager. On the way to find a table, two other men who looked old enough to be my grandfather blatantly turned and ogled me as I walked by and then giggled when I looked at them.

I tried to do a review on their website directly and after filling in their forms, it wouldn't even accept it.

Service: 3.5/5 (It takes a while for the waitress to get to you when it's busy.)  There are 2 levels. The first floor only has a few seats. If you want to avoid tipping then it's best to stay on the first floor. The second floor is where people will sit in and a server will take your order. The place gets busy around 4 pm. I really appreciate that they have a variety of tea choices. A small piece of their signature chocolate comes with any drink that one orders.\", 'Waited ages for our food, it arrived cold and we only got half of what we ordered, but the staff were friendly.', \"What can I say...its just GREAT.

I booked a table for 8 of us, a week later after I made the booking (a month before Valentine’s Day) I ring up the restaurant to ask them to add ONE seat on our table as my younger sister was allowed the time off work to come, (she wasn’t when we booked it), so I thought brilliant I’ll just call up, it’s one person, shouldn’t be a problem. But no, the staff who answered the phone were not helpful or sympathetic to my enquiry at all, all I got was a straight ‘no, it’s our busiest day we don’t have any space’. I pleaded with them, saying I do not mind if we are all squashed on that table I just need an extra chair I can’t leave my sister out of our moms 50th birthday! Still the answer was no no no. I was told to ring if they had any cancellations, I rang every single day up until now and still all I got was a straight no, no one tried to help me at all. I’m so upset with them it’s unbelievable. There is absolutely no ‘amazing’ customer service at this place. I worked in customer service for 4 years of my life and there is no way I would of chosen to say no to a table of 8 then to just add an extra person as a good gesture. Where is kindness in this world? So disappointed and they’ve lost a good customer.', 'I absolutely love this sushi bar, the selection is amazing, the quality of the sushi is outstanding, really fresh ingredients, always freshly made and most importantly it tastes divine. Favorite sushi in dubai. They also do home catering which I love ordering when I have gatherings, my guests are always blown away.', 'A few things: First, this place is very expensive.

I ordered the Monster burger which was advertised as a double beef patty, when it arrived they had gave me the wrong order. It was a chicken burger meal. I explained that I had indeed got the wrong meal so they changed it for me. My wife also got the wrong meal. Plus my wife's burger was supposed to have bacon on it, the manager apologised and gave her bacon on a saucer.

She called me back to say that he did not and so i asked if they could send another as there was not enough food for my guests. The response was that the kitchen was closed and they would not send out another order so all she could do was refund me the money. So rude, no customer service whatsoever and I ended up having to dig through my fridge for leftovers to supplement the mean amounts of food delivered.

On this visit we thought we would try Club A after all the great reviews. Shame we did... Firstly, the steak was over cooked and under seasoned. Definitely not a good filet. Second, the starters were poor - salads limp, tomatoes flavorless. Thirdly the service was poor and intrusive and finally the furnishing were drab and dingy.', 'Fatty steak. Burnt calamari.

Everything tastes fresh, and the hot dishes were actually hot and freshly made. They have plenty of options for everyone in the menu and it arrived at a very good time (not too fast that you worry about the quality and not too long where you wait)Secondly the service was excellent - everybody was very friendly, and they even offered us some cheeky sake at the end as a bit of a palate cleanser - Yong was the nice chap who did.The environment is super cozy and chilled.I’m from Manchester and will be coming here a lot more, so give it a try for yourself!', \"Everything very tasty.

And I'm sorry to say that the service is the worst I've ever experienced in any coffeeshop, anywhere. It's not the employees' fault, though; they seem to be always staffed at the wrong place at the wrong time. Or maybe Maman is just understaffed. There is basically ONE person working the register/espresso machine every day during the morning rush. And no one seems capable of managing the flow -- like not making some exotic-milk cappuccino before filling the two drip-coffee orders.  Also, weirdly, they run out of stuff for weeks on end, and don't seem to be able to get more in. Things like, LARGE CUPS. Which we are now on week two without. Oy. Or loyalty stamp cards. (Why not just print something out on the office computer, or overnight less-cutesy-but-still-functional large cups from Amazon?)  A lot of tourists come in and hover awkwardly in a too-small place. A guy keeps his dog at the table sometimes. And the kitchen doesn't open until 8am even though they open at 7am.\", \"It feels like a place offering some bits from different cuisines.

The dish I had was worse than something I would put together in 20 minutes just because I need to survive after a long day at work: average taste, bad presentation and poor quality. There is a chance that over dishes on the menu are of better quality, but based on the experience I’ve just had i wouldn’t try again this place. I’m suprized that this restaurant survives the competition, there are so many restaurants in Gothenburg which are you way much better!!! The service was ok but not excellent.

Atmosphere was nice and only thing above average during our trip but bathroom is in the sports book.  One of my friends eats a plant based diet and there was nothing on the menu to eat.

There are two Pinocchios and we visited the bigger of the two but really don’t think we’ll be coming back. The restaurant was packed and luckily we’d booked so we were seated ok but the service was just really terrible. The staff ignored us most of the time and took a long time to take our orders. When we did order our food all came at different times with some of us finishing before the others had even started. I had spaghetti with prawns which was cold and tasteless but there was no one to tell. The rest of the meals were ok but lukewarm at best.

We tried the quiche matpaj, minced meat and chicken and they were typical fatty and salty type of fast food. Mandelrulle was uncooked and full of artificial colours and had this really intense pharmacy taste of chemicals. The mazipan or something like that was extremely sweet and as with every pastry we tasted was RAW. The sweet pastry were the chocolate gateau which was like childish flavor, not real chocolate or anything like produced from raw materials. The bärpaj was just confiture with again raw dough.

I’ve honestly never had a worse dining experience in my life. I would strongly recommend that you eat anywhere else BUT here, our money would have been much better spent at McDonald’s.  We waited an hour for our food, there were multiple people who sat down after us and were served before our food came. I asked for a rare steak, and they gave me one that was medium. My boyfriend ordered salmon, and it was inedible - it was still raw and wasn’t cooked through! Further, the food was served to us cold, it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. The only edible thing we got was the baguette. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this was the worst dining experience of my life, DO NOT GO HERE!!', 'Food was awesome service was great!

No one came to our table and we were not offered a drink for over 20 minutes although other tables were being served. We explained to the Manager and our order was eventually taken. The other waiters were explaining the specials etc and looking after their guests. Our waiter eventually arrived with the drinks after being reminded by the Manager and he literally threw them down. He never asked again if we needed anything else and nor did the Manager. Having been here many times over the years, the standard of food and service has definitely decreased and what should have been a special day was spoiled.

Of course this was not mentioned before, I had the surprise when the check arrived. On top of that, they make clear that tip is not included, and should be given.

But when I picked one up, I could smell rotten seafood right away even before getting it up close to my nose. We returned the dish to the kitchen and it was taken off the bill.

We had chef's tasting menu and it was complete waste of money...neither taste nor variety. Not recommended\", \"My husband and I had high expectations but sadly were let down as the quality of the food was not good. We shared a very, very small lobster and a very fatty and tasteless aged steak. A total waste of money to be honest. One positive for the restaurant though is that the waiters were very attentive. But the fact we left most of our food on the plates must have been a very clear message that we weren't impressed.\", 'Awful service! Staff is super rude!

The desserts were awful - especially the ‘apple’ dessert. It was not good value for money. In addition. - the service was not very good.

The waitresses are polite and very welcoming I will definitely go back again to try other delicious dishes', \"This place is clean, vibrant, interesting, and bigger than it seems. I ordered a carrot cake, which wasn't too bad, and a matcha latte. The matcha latte is very strong compared to what I am used to, but otherwise, this isn't a bad place to go to.  I will say that this place is a bit pricier than a Starbucks, but it has an elegant feel to the location. This is a great spot for meetups and a place to relax and chill. It seems like large groups of people like to come here to relax and hang out with other people, since there were a bunch of people with name tags were pretty much taking over most of the top floor.

Let me say, the food was great. That's exactly where it ends. First of all it was 30 deg C inside and we were sweating the entire time we sat there. Overlookable if the rest was great. It wasn't. If not for the server with the cool mustache we would've given it a one star. Our main server, a young female, was the worst I've experienced in any country in a long time.

My Gina sandwich came within seconds. It was like I was given someone else's order. The guy literally shoved it at my face. To make matters even worse, the sandwich looked like some tuna was tossed on the ciabatta bread with no lettuce and roasted tomatoes.

The service was excellent: warm and attentive.  I tried the Curried Herring Smorrebread (pictured).  It was quite a small portion but it was very tasty and quite refreshing in terms of flavours and texture.  A friend had the eggs and avocado: good quality but a bit ordinary save that the butter was fantastic. Seriously - have the butter (by itself if necessary).The coffee was a double-edged sword. It is a good strong brew but when served it is VERY hot and the mugs have no handles. I'm sure this is a Nordic thing but it did mean that we had to wait a while before we could drink it.That said, my experience was very positive. So much so, I went back the next day for a takeaway breakfast of a cinnamon bun and coffee.

I've also purchased some hot chocolate here which is my family's new favorite!  The espresso bar upstairs is also lovely.

This place is wonderful. From the outdoor heaters on the chilly morning, to the wonderfully attentive staff, to the creative selection of food, this place is a MUST see in Las Vegas. Our breakfast was their wonderful eggs hollandaise. I am gluten free so I ordered the gluten free toast option with eggs and smoked salmon. The gluten free toast was unlike any gluten free toast that I have had, it tasted simply scrumptious! And the coffee was perfect- perfectly aromatic and we could not get enough cups of it. Since our breakfast was phenomenal, we decided to visit Mon Ami Gabi for dinner the following night. My husband had the filet mignon which was delicious and cooked to perfection, plus his fries were gluten free! I had the Trout Almondine which was cooked very well and the green beans were perfect. Their wine list is extensive and their Bourdeaux wine was the best I've had in a long time. Overall, I cannot say enough positive things about this restaurant.

WORST PLACE ON THE ISLAND.', 'Not worth the money you can choose other buffet compared to this.', 'The most awful and awkward dining experience I have ever had. I’ve never written a review like this but after eating out at Bala Baya I feel compelled to shed light on this restaurant’s incompetence. I had booked a table well in advance, hoping to secure a good seat in the restaurant, so we were a bit disappointed to be sat right by the entrance door on a bitter February night. Never mind, we thought, we were looking forward to the good food we’d heard about. We’d ordered cocktails at the bar on arrival from someone who presumably would be waiting our table that night. Once seated, the same waiter came over again and asked us if we’d like any drinks, even though we had just ordered with him. The drinks then took 15 minutes to come to our table. This confusion was not a big deal on its own, but unfortunately, with hindsight, it was setting the tone for the evening. We ordered the £42 set menu and were told that food would arrive ‘in waves; as and when its ready’. 45 minutes passed, and the first dish still hadn’t arrived. It then became apparent that something had gone wrong when the waiters were whispering amongst themselves while pointing at our table. A whole hour after ordering, the first dish arrived - sweet potato hummus. Great, but not what was on the set menu we ordered. I guess we were now being served the other set menu from that evening. We confirmed with another waiter which set menu we had ordered from (there were only two as far as I was aware so not exactly difficult to remember) and three dishes arrived in quick succession. Once we finished these the waiter cleared away our plates and asked if we were ready for our dessert, despite the fact we were still waiting for three more main dishes to arrive. You could see the panic on the waiter’s face as he realised these dishes probably weren’t going to be ready for quite some time… And they weren’t. Another 15 minutes passed and only one other main arrived. Unfortunately, it was a dish we had already eaten. We were told it was on the house because of how long we had waited, but we declined as we were saving room for the other dishes we had ordered. When the fish plate came out it was cold and felt like it had been sitting around for quite some time. By this point we had been in the restaurant for almost two hours and had lost patience. The waiter said we could have a drink on the house because of the poor service, but we just wanted our remaining dishes. It had now been over two hours since we ordered and it was clear these dishes were never going to arrive so we asked the waiter for dessert - which we did eventually receive. So we didn’t get all of the dishes on the set menu; the service was so unbelievably poor as we were constantly forgotten about; and everything was made awkward by the fact we could see the waiters laughing and whispering about us and our table. We felt that the staff gave minimal effort to rectify the evening and they made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. They gave us a 20% discount - the best they could do - meaning we reluctantly paid just over £90 for this absolute disaster of an experience (it would have been over £100 including the service charge but obviously we didn’t pay this, and frankly it was quite insulting to even include this on the bill). There were plenty more examples of incompetence from Bala Baya that I haven’t mentioned in this review as they’re too embarrassing to publicly air.', 'We ordered a starter edamame and beer and also dinner specials. Food was brought out all at once. Quality was meh - below average. Would not recommend', 'Disappointed, came to same restaurant last year , so much more choice , and manager very rude', 'You must try the sweet potato fries!', 'My teenage son really fancied a steak after a busy day sightseeing. We arrived and were told that a table would be ready in 10-15 minutes, however after 45 minutes we were shown our table. The restaurant is busy and small. I chose the Caroline Chicken with rustic chips, however this was overcooked and dry. I am convinced the chips had not seen a fryer and tasted like cheap oven chips. The toilets were dirty with paper towels thrown everywhere. My son really enjoyed steak, but I shall not be returning.', 'the food was really good with very generous portions. the sauces were very flavourful and tasty and the seating was very cosy with a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. the service from Ali and the team was very attentive.

Half of our party was already seated and we were joining a little later.

We explained that we were the ones the table had been reserved for and she said she would clear it up with staff and come back. She never did.Drink order was messed up, only one of the 4 entrees came out as they were ordered and the food was very bland and not fresh at all despite being right on the water. Our server cussed (even though we were there as a family with our children) while entering our order into her handheld device and seemed very scattered and unfamiliar with the device and the menu.I’m s the bill came, we paid online with a barcode on the check and got up to leave, the waitress accused of of trying to run out on our bill!

Food was OK, not really worth the price in my eyes but the cocktails were lovely!

The place occupies a prime corner spot with nice views of the park, and the owners have put a lot into the decor (its like HOME). After checking the menu, I was also pleasantly suprised: mac n cheese, parmesan fries, arancini... Sadly, the food is beyond lacklustre. And I don't understand why: I mean, how can you go wrong with dough balls? In some cases, the food is bland and lacks seasoning. The mac n cheese is horrific. Its presented in a deep dish, so you just dig into three inches of blandness (its supposed to be cooked in a shallow dish, with a crispy topping!). In other cases, the food is a little too try-hard. Carrot pizza? Cod cheek pizza? Seriously, people - is there much demand  for these dishes? Same too for the cocktails - almost everything has a pointless 'twist' to it, with ridiculous, non-essential additions to your mojito or bellini such as popping candy and candy floss. Hey Laundrette! Don't mess with the classics! On the plus side, the ambiance is nice, service friendly and the wine list good. So, if you fancy sitting outside on a warm day and people-watching, this place is great. Just make sure you eat before you get there.\", 'This was an awful experience amongst all the wonderful places we ate in.', 'Nice food,generous portions,waiter was ok.

Even called to confirm table request and when arrived again confirmed.No luck - we sat upstair first table by bar, across from bathroom, and high traffic walk way.

Ended up with a drink we got from the bar and water.Did not find the service to be great as the waiters all seemed to be overwhelmed by crowd and owner who walked around seemed to scare them because it was so busy.Coat check was a mess as it is located feet from the bar, door, reception and stairs. The crowd was large and the nice girl dropped our scarf and gloves and was unable to retrieve as so many people were standing around stepping on them. Overall a mess of a night.

So, we make the trek onsite, approach the host stand and ask to place a take out order. 'We don't do takeout orders' was the response. It was Christmas day and not much else was open so we went home with our tail between our legs. Dont get me wrong, a business not doing takeout orders is there prerogative. But don't tell me 20-30 minutes beforehand to 'be onsite to place a takeout order'I have no idea if the food is good or if it is worth going here.

Next, we waited longer than usual for our food which was handed to us in crumbled up to go bag (we were dining-in), I guess due to Covid, they can get away without serving you on tray. I don't see how that's anything but an excuse to be lazy because it's really not sanitary to have to eat off a napkin or flattened bag that was handled by someone who probably didn't wash their hands 5 minutes prior.

The accompanying wine paring was fairly priced although we did not partake. The three outstanding dishes were the hiramasa, a squid ink pasta and the egg dessert, each of which had multiple layers of taste and texture and visually impressive. The service throughout was never less than outstanding; it was paced so that we were not rushed but we also never waited more than 5 mins between courses. We were offered an explanation as each dish was served as to its ingredients and/or how the chef intended it be consumed, and our water and wine glasses were never empty before someone came to fill or inquire.

We go to very few restaurants, only when we have detailed conversations with the manager beforehand and are comfortable with what she or he says.  I spoke with the Clyde's manager, Dave, a few weeks ago and then again the day before.  He assured me that they'd prepare our daughter's food in their second kitchen, away from cc risk.  She is ana to sesame, mustard, lentils and fish.  When we arrived, the person at the front immediately knew the allergens list, and said that the manager would come see us.  He did, and the waitress also told us that she would check our order with both the chef and the manager.  She came back to confirm what we could and could not have (we don't eat our daughter's allergens with her, although we don't mind cc risk in our food, of course).  Our daughter's food - main course and dessert - was brought to the table by the manager.  She was able to have a burger in a restaurant for the first time ever.  They replaced the normal Clyde's sesame (yikes!) bun with something else.  Their beef mince is mustard-free and they did not include the pickle.  She couldn't have fries because on weekends they fry the crabcakes in the same oil as the fries (!) and although we are pretty sure she is okay with all crustaceans and molluscs, she has never had crab and a rainy Saturday night is not the time to take any risks. She was oddly happy with a salad instead.  Anyway, the short of it is that we had something other than pizza out at a restaurant and that is a rare occurrence.  Huge thank you to Clyde's and we will go back.  All of the staff were brilliant and surprised that we thought they were doing anything but what every other restaurant does...if only! \", 'The place, the service and the food were amazing, we had a great breakfast ,many varieties from jam to eggs and cheese .

Music SOOOOOOO loud and inappropriate. You can't hear food description nor your party chatting. Antisocial. Carl who runs things is just lovely however the sommelier rather denigrating.

The place is split into 2 levels, with a coffee bar, chocolates, and various other treats on the first level, while the second level is a sit down full service section.  Sat upstairs, which was roomier than you would expect for a location so close to grand central. The frappe was good, it was not as sweet as I expected, which is a great thing. There is sugar on the table for those of you who need a bit more sugar rush. Each drink was served on a silver platter with a glass of water and a square of house made dark chocolate. Great touch. The chocolate was 72% cocoa and nicely balanced the coffee.  The only thing I would improve was the service, or waitress was a bit slow and was fairly disinterested in us as customers. Lastly, there are no to-go cups if you decided to sit upstairs. Overall good experience.', 'Most delicious food, lovely service, lovely atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone.

The atmosphere and interior of the restaurant was very nice. However, the food was SO disappointing. Both of our steaks came out as cooked the wrong way. All the food was loaded with way too much salt. The service was hit or miss during their attempts to fix the problem. They do bring out a lot of items \"on the house\" for you to try while you are dining. However, we did not like the taste of most of it all. The Macaroni and Cheese was elbow noodles in a bowl which looked like Kraft Mac N Cheese. The Creamed Spinach was so bland we sent it back. The owner did take care of our meal and was very kind. However the wait staff was rude at times and wasnt around to refill water or bring silverware when it was needed. Try Bobby Vans Steakhouse instead.', \"Popped in on the off-chance and left a big fan! We were served by Sophie who was really welcoming, warm and friendly. Water's brought to the table with the menus, which is nice. All the food was fab, loads of vegan choices and everything was tasty and lovely.

Waiter was very good, read and understood his customers, made recommendations without being pushy, and with charm. Great selection of cocktails and very tasty. Not a.lerge menu, but everything on there was just lush, and the most difficult decision was trying to decide what to have. Duck pâté starter lush, keralan monkfish/prawn curry delicious, but the best of all was the dessert. Rum baba!

Service is always great!', 'Been here mant times for a pint. Had lunch this weekend and it was really good. Beef stew was great and so was the open seafood sandwaich. And very reasonably priced too', \"Based on #1 out of 8900 restaurants by TripAdvisor for NYC, we had a high expectations by reserving a table during our recent visit. When we arrived at 7 pm on time for our reserved time, the restaurant was cleaning up after a small banquet. We got to our table about 20 minutes later by an unfriendly hostess. While we were waiting, we sat at the bar and wanted a drink. The bartender said, he wasn't filling any drinks at the bar because he was busy filling orders from dinner customers. I have never had that experience. Appetizers were decent but average. The steak took too long to come out with the sides and the steak was lukewarm like it was sitting around after cooking for about 20 minutes. Multiple people came by to ask what we wanted but it usually took about 3rd waiter to get something like Tabasco sauce. I go to steakhouses all the time and this was absolutely the worse experience. I am not sure what other travelers saw when they collectively gave it a top restaurant in NYC.\", \"The wait staff tried so hard to be accomodating, but we were very happy we ordered an appetizer before dinner. It wasn't good, very tough and dried out, so we ended up leaving before dinner. The wait staff wanted to replace our appetizers, but we had no interest in staying. I'm very surprised at all the good reviews. There was a young man in front encouraging folks to come in and they had the Trip Adviser reviews posted outside. You can do MUCH better for excellent Indian food in London.\", 'The food was ok, but when I wanted to pay, the waiter asked me for his tip. I told him to add 10% as a tip to the bill. Only to find out that he added 40% as a tip! I went to him and confronted him, and got angry that I asked for my money back! This is a disgrace!', 'Thanks to Tripadvisor we found this marvelous place. Excellent food in a funky environment. The decor is very special and Thai. The only thing missing is the barefoot feeling of sand.', 'went for an evening meal with 5 people, ordered their special menu £19.95 per person minimum order of 2. The deal included 4 hot mezze and 4 Cold mezze and a mix grill or mix Shwarma. Firstly the portions were tine and secondly the main meal came out cold and the meat on the mix grill was no fresh. Sorry but the food was not good, service too slow and nothing will make me recommend this place.', 'They even made vegetable sushi rolls (no fish) for our fish allergic son in the kitchen away from the sushi station and any cross contamination!

Arrogant manager who really wasn't interested in us - I asked for a burger to be medium rare and he saiid they only served them well done! I noticed 2 other diners sent their food back. We ended up having ribs which were ok but not tender, sweet corn was soggy but the chips were lovely! Beer ok too. Expensive at £50 for a one course supper for the two of us.Other staff seemed pleasant enough.

Good ambience and staff helpful, although first time we were asked by the waitress if we would like to tip! We prefer to decide and not feel forced. However, on second visit the waiter was not as direct and we were happy to tip and more for service. The food was enjoyable and fairly priced.', \"I recently was at the restaurant and was treated very poorly by the Valet service that represents and is present onsite at the restaurant. When I appealed to the management team at the restaurant, they told me that they would not intervene. They allowed the valet service to threaten me, this to me is unacceptable. I entertain regularly in the Austin area and work for a fortune 50 company. I have warned my fellow co-workers of the abusive nature of my experience, and that they could possibly expect this if they entertained here as well. I will never return. I wrote a review on another site and someone from one of the org's attacked me. Another reason I feel I am making the right choice. I warn that this could happen to anyone who visits this org.\", 'The food arrived in good time, was delicious and we both went back to our room very satisfied.

We were offered a free glass of wine to come in, but the staff had to verify the deal with the door before agreeing. The papadum sauce was terrible and most likely from a jar. It was like eating sweet chilli sauce. Entree was delicious. The mains took over an hour and a half to come out. When we queried it, they said it would be another 3-4 minutes. What we got was NOT what we ordered despite them insisting it was. We cancelled one main dish which they forgot to remove from the bill until queried. What was served was flavourless and over salted. The naan was okay. We refused to pay the service fee which was automatically added to the bill. Left disappointed and hungry. It was a true shame my impression of London Indian food has been ruined by this very place', \"The restaurant is small and I am not sure what its like when its busy but it didn't feel crowded when we were there. Whilst it was a nice visit, I don't think I would return. Having not had greek before, I felt the menu wasn't as clear as it could be when describing the dishes. Greek salad was disappointing as I expected there to be more to it and I expected more than just chicken and a bit of lettuce on the plate when I ordered the chicken kebab. The service was good but I was left disappointed\", 'Amazing service, Mizan was amazing! Great service and super friendly. Amazing food, 100% recommend the corma and the onion Bhajis were the best I’ve ever had!', 'The lady at the Front is unfriendly.', 'Just awful. Started with following hostess to table she throws the menus on a random table and walks off to bicker with coworkers without so much a looking back. Never got my coffee, even after server realized she forgot it and said she’ll be right back. We never saw her again. We missed breakfast so I thought I’d order chicken and waffle but wasn’t mentioned in the menu was the waffle was of the savory variety with corn and jalapeños inside and coated in chili pepper and sliced jalapeños. But not their fault so I asked someone walking by for additional syrup and he acted like we put him out of his way. Toast was cold like styrofoam and the rest of the food was just not good. Got the bill from another server and had to send him back to remove the coffee never received. Terrible service and way to pricy for the food to just be bad.', \"Go someplace else. We stopped for two quick coffees and were charged SEK147 (approx AUD21). Coffee was weak and only barely warm. Didn't even get a smile for that. Total tourist rip off - and not a menu or price list in site.\", 'Steaks not served as requested, the biggest let down. Medium rare were served raw and cold only seared on the outside. Medium well were done so long the steak knives were barely able to penetrate. Not what we expected from an expensive $$$$$ restaurant. Maybe the regular chef was off for the holiday and they used a volunteer who ruined our meal.', \"The food was great, but I give it only a poor rating due to the unwanted attention (more below). I met friends here for dinner one evening. It was a bit cool and we sat in the rear patio area, surrounded by walls but no roof. They did have awnings with heaters to keep folks comfortable. There was a great menu, and I opted for grilled salmon, rosemary potatoes, veggies and salad greens. Very delicious. Downside: Our waiter, who may have even been the owner, took drink orders then reached out and ran the back of his fingers along the upper arm of one of the women in our party of four! She didn't know what to think. He was quite obviously flirting with her, and she was not thrilled. When he returned with their wine, he offered the same woman a taste, she approved, he poured, and then stroked her arm again. Had I not been sitting in the corner, unable to get up, I just might have slugged him. She was not flirtatious at all and was not pleased by his attention. Food was fine, service NOT so!\", 'Really disappointed with our meal. Was expecting good things due to the high rating on trip advisor but was informed half the menu was unavailable, the service was poor and the food was average. Wish we had gone somewhere else for the money we paid. Would definitely not go back. ', 'I ate here on Friday night. Although it was ok to start with, all my friends got their food before me. I had to wait a further 15 minutes before I got my food. When it arrived the server handed the dish over to me and as i took it it the curry spilled on my finger. It was so physically hot it burned my finger. I ran to the bathroom and ran it under the tap for 20 minutes. No staff came to check or apologised. Finally I went back upstairs and asked for a glass of water for my finger so i could attempt to eat my food and they took 5 minutes to get that for me. In the meantime the pain was so bad. At the end of the meal there was no apology and I was in so much pain I just wanted to leave so paid without thinking. No discount or money was taken off. Two days later my finger has a huge blister and is still in pain. Food should not be so hot that it burns your skin.Picture of burn below.', 'Great pizza. My husband and I had a cheese pizza.

Unfortunately the service was horrible, our server didn’t talk or smile at all, it seemed like he didn’t speak any english. Also his manners and gestures were very unprofessional. I’m not a demanding customer but we got very unwelcoming feeling. The food was also quite a disappointment, both of our meals were very salty and other way tasteless. The sauce in my meal was very plain and the meat tasteless. I don’t know if only the locals get good service here?? Very sad experience.

We came here on our vacation and enjoyed so much the first time that we made a point to come back once more before going home, bringing a dozen donuts with us.', 'Overpriced, ridiculous, tasteless bland steaks. I totally understand that many people like their steaks cooked differently, but I apologise I will not be paying £30 for a steak again for me to be cooking it myself. What exactly am I paying for? Portion of chips size was ridiculous, a tiny portion that a toddler could eat 10 of. Waitor was extremely welcoming but made me feel stupid Infront of other customers, asking me whether i need help cooking my own steak, he was literally watching me from start to finish.

There is water right there by you, when you get overflowing drink mixtures or whatever on your hands and sweat your pants is not a towel, so grab one with soap and water. The bigger restaurants are getting sloppy with their service and that's why I either don't eat fast food where I can't see them cooking it or I always check my glass for fingerprints around the rim.

Food was so so, but a majority of the menu was unavailable and drastically limited our options. Chips were served lukewarm, upon being asked to be served warm, were returned at a no further satisfactory tempature, and required another request for hot chips for the problem to be resolved. Along with a majority of the menu being unavailable, they were unable to provide the simplest condiment of ketchup.', 'The quality of the main course and the dessert was surprisingly tasteless and badly presented.

I thought it was like a Starbucks kinda coffee shop where you order your coffee and serve yourself, but when the cashier asked me if it was for here or to go, I said, \"For here.\" Then, I found out there was a whole other floor above this shop. It has a clean, modern layout with a variety of table sizes and chairs. Some seats were comfy, cushiony sofas, but I opted for a seat against the ledge and ordered a macchiato while I studied my GRE.  Surprisingly, there were quite a large flow sitting in around 7/8am. Many seemed like corporate workers with suits and ties while some looked like tourists or travelers as they had a carry on luggage. I mean 2Beans is conveniently located by Grand Central Terminal.  I ordered a macchiato that was served in a sleet, clear glass with a piece of chocolate. It was about $6 with tax and tip.

We booked a table a couple of months ahead and even though we arrived a bit early we were seated immediately.I ordered the Rib-Eye and my girlfriend the Filet Mignon. We were not impressed. The steak was a bit too much on the medium-welldone side but mainly it was just over-seasoned and not enjoyable. Even worse were the fries that we took as a side dish which we did not even touch. Positive point here is that after mentioning the \"lumpy\" fries we where not charged for them.

They have one item that I can eat on their menu, they sub in something else and expect me to be happy).

And I noticed this all over the place. All of the servers were more into idle chit chat and all of the customers were being ignored.Finally, our food, truthfully was NOT what I would have expected. My father in law had a huge seafood platter and the crab legs had no meat in them at all and were impossible to crack because they were squishy. My wife and my lunches were seemingly fine except for my fried fish and shrimp tasted as though the oil had not been changed in a long time.All in all, it was a bad experience. I would have complained to a manager but never once saw one.

As such I feel we are fairly well positioned to pick out a decent one from a dud.There have been some great places I've eaten at, most of which have very good reviews on this site but never have I read so many positive reviews to then be served with such average (at best) food.When asked if they had any chilli pickle for papadums the waiter told us that they don't have any as its too hot for the tourists. That is what this place is, Indian food for tourists who wouldn't normally eat Indians - if that’s what you are after and you like being fairly cramped and filthy toilets then get yourself down here right now.I'm not saying that Indian food has to be hot to be good, far from it, but even their hottest dish was only on the warm side of medium.I'm glad one of us ordered this though because the medium lamb dish we ordered was tasteless. The only positive was that the lamb was actually quite tender but it was ruined by the bland curry it was served in.I certainly wont be returning here and if you appreciate good curry then I suggest you also avoid it.\", 'Really good breakfast alternatives and friendly staff', 'Was on my own for the day and decided to have lunch here.

The waitress had checked with the kitchen to make sure the cajun spices were in stock before we ordered, she was told they were. Mine and my girlfriends chicken burger tasted nothing like cajun just plain chicken, it had Cajun mayonnaise on it which was no good as my girlfriend ordered it with no sauce/mayo. The chips were also undercooked. It seems that mayo was used as the spices must have been out of stock. My friend also found a large hair in his meal which they did knock some money off for.

So for $57 the platter consisted of 4 shrimp, 4 oysters, a small cup of salmon tataki and some crackers. We then ordered onion soup. It was so salty that it was inedible.

I specifically ask the waiter if they could do rare, he said yes and when I showed him the steak, he explained to me that they do some kind of slow cooking and because of that can't do rare. We waited 15 minuts for a dessert and had to leave before as our daughter got tired. As we were to pay the Bill, the dessert came and they wanted us to pay half of the dessert.

Food arrived promptly once ordered and there was no sense of being dished to leave for the next sitting. At that kind of price though, I don’t think it is too much to ask for orders (especially aperitifs) to be taken more promptly. It was shame, because when it came, the service was very good.

I asked him if there was anything we should avoid he told me all pesto pastas. (I knew this already since these dishes have pine nuts)  My daughter decided to have the Sunday pasta dish which was spaghetti, meatballs and sausage. I then verified with my server that this dish was safe. He said yes but I will go check he then came back and told the dish was not safe. The meatballs contained nuts! I was so thankful I asked who would think meatballs has Pine nuts in it? I then just got her a side of plain pasta with butter. I called the manager over and stressed the main reason why I visited was because I read a lot how committed they were to nut allergies and how they should really say on the menu the meatballs has nut, he just shrugged his shudders and walked away. Not happy. Will never go back. Beware.   ', 'We showed up about 25min early and asked if they were ready for us; happy to wait if they weren’t.

The pizza we ordered said it came with a Pomodoro sauce, yet it came with only chunky tomatoes and raw onions. The menu did not say it was a \"white pizza.\" I do not like raw onions on my food, and never would have ordered that pizza. Very misleading! The manager, older gray haired man, was rude when we brought all of this to his attention and called us liars. Customers should never be treated this way!!

First, we had to wait a while to even get cups for our water. Then it took a long time to get 1/3 orders. If that wasnt bad enough, the server messed up our order and had forgotten about us. After the order mix up, it took even longer to get our remaining order and 2 bowls of rice and to top it off our gyoza was barely even fried. We were not the only ones to have that service that day.

Best steak I ever had (Prime Porterhouse which was highly recommended by our waiter), great live jazz music, cozy ambience, and friendly staff, among other things. After finishing the steak, we were surprised by the desert plate with cheesecake, tiramisu and another delicious sweets. It was on the restaurant.

Each bento consisted of rice, (slightly greasy) noodles, some dressed salad leaves, and the main. My Tempura was ok, but paying an extra £2.20 for \"mixed\" included 2 very very small squid rings.

We were pleased with the chef and his knowledge of our sons food allergies. One child is allergic to peanuts and the other has a egg allergy. Both are severe in nature. Both kids enjoyed their meals and we were all happy with the service.However after leaving the restaurant and driving on the Las Vegas strip my son with the egg allergy started vomiting and not feeling well. We went back to our hotel and because of more allergic reaction symptoms had to administer an EPI-Pen as well as call 911. He was then taken to the ER for observation. My wife and I feel because of the delayed reaction it must have been some type of cross contamination as the chef seemed very aware of food allergens. After the fact I did recall when they brought his meal out the plates were all together on the waiters arms. Very close to the other meals ordered. It was either there or in the kitchen that the cross contamination occurred. I called the restaurant after the fact and made the chef aware of what occurred and he was shocked. He was going to find out what happened but after one conversation he never called me back. I am sure he was advised by his superior not to discuss further with us. I wish the restaurant or someone higher up would have investigated this further and look into their procedures and given us an explanation if possible. This was an incredibly frightful experience while we were on vacation and needless to say the rest of our vacation we only ate would we prepared in our hotel room.', 'Good coffee and tasty breakfast.

It was a large private event and it is clear they are not equipped to handle events of this size. That is ok, but then don\\'t agree to host them! Service was beyond terrible. We had to ask even to fill a water glass, and even that took time but that was nothing compared to waiting for food. This was an absolute record - 30 minutes wait for a salad and full 1.5 HOURS (I timed it) for steaks. Their excuse was \\'well, some people ordered well done and it takes longer\". Sorry, that is not much of an excuse. Many people got tired of waiting and took doggie bags. Food itself was pretty good, both salad and meat but certainly not worth the wait. Sorry, folks, but you aren\\'t Peter Luger, Del Frisco, Sparks or Wolfgang\\'s. I\\'ll make sure no more corporate events come your way from us.', 'Things looked promising when we arrived, but it all went downhill after that. The famous huge cinnamon buns that sat perched on a pastry rack behind the counter were unavailable when we arrived, they were fake. The real ones were sold out early in the day. So we chose a vanilla cake and a shortbread. We also ordered the traditional shrimp on bread and quiche. The cake was dry, icing was granular. Everything tasted very sugary without a lot of flavor. The shortbread had no buttery taste, just that same granulated sugar taste with no flavor. As I was eating it it just crumbled into dust from being so dried out. The shrimp would have been good, but they were on top of at least 1/2 cup of bad tasting Miracle Whip mayonnaise, ugh. The bread was so thick and spongy it overpowered the dish. The egg was excellent though, along with the vegetables on the side. The quiche was the winner. Pass on the tourist trap sweets and get yourself a quiche, it was flavorful and well made. The coffee is just ok, I expected better coffee in a pastry shop. The girl who checked us out was American. She’s very nice, just wish she had warned us!', 'Well well! Went there with a friend who recommended this place to us and I was mighty surprised. I have never been a high end foodie but I am completely happy having gone to Indian accent.', \"Unfortunately we weren't aware that a private party was being hosted in the upstairs of the restaurant on Saturday evening which we feel was the reason we were left so disappointed with our experience. We would like have liked to be sat in the upstairs area as it felt more welcoming and warmer both physically and in ambience. Once we arrived we spoken briefly to one of the managers who seated us, he explained that the menu was designed as sharing which is fine and we said as it was a special occasion for us, and our own preferences, we would prefer to order one course at a time to share and making a real evening of it. We were then told we should order all at once and that the dishes would likely come separately and spread out. Sadly this wasn't the case apart from the first dish of aubergine mess (which was actually delicious) all the other plates came out in pairs, and we also had an overlap in servings so we ended up with a lot of food on the table which just made us feel we couldn't relax and make our way through each course properly. It occurred to us afterwards that we were told to order like this due to the party and the restaurant being under pressure with staff numbers etc and made us feel as though they were trying to rush through the service of the diners downstairs as quickly as possible so they could focus on the party upstairs. After our initial order we struggled to get hold of anyone in the team to order more drinks and dishes so were on one occasion left with nothing to drink at our table for some while. I was also sat facing the pass and saw two of our dishes sat for around 5 minutes before being served to us. The team were all rushed off of their feet and we felt a little neglected. Other things we would have enjoyed is someone to give us some of their time to discuss the wine list and the Israeli wine as we were not familiar with it and would have loved to learn more. The most disappointing thing was that the two dishes we were most excited about; prawn baklava and tempura monkfish were so underwhelming. The prawns were presented beautifully and were very instagrammable but both of these plates came to us almost cold by the time we were served them. The prawns felt as though they were lacking a flavour dimension and were more style over substance (for us), and then our tempura monkfish wasn't cripsy and the batter was limp and cold. The upsides were that the prawns and monkfish were both good meaty portions of fish, and the harissa caramel was lovely. I was actually using the harissa caramel with my prawns to enhance the flavour and whilst glasses were being cleared someone also took the plate away before I realised so I couldn't even finish enjoying the prawns to my taste. We see that the place has the potential to be wonderful and we just landed on a very bad day. The cocktails and burnt babka were lovely despite all of this. However based purely on our experience we aren't likely to return or recommend it - but as I've said it was unfortunate timing with short staff and a private party so please make your own judgement.\", 'This is one of the oldest cafes in Buenos Aries.

The waiter gave us a table and a man who seemed the owner gave us the menu. He came back 30 seconds later to take the order and we asked him for 2 more minutes. He came again so quick, not even this 2 minutes, so we asked him for a recommendation, he chose for us the carpaccio ( clearly prepared many hours ago) and “bruschetta al aglio” (full of oil and excessively generous with the garlic), and after one more minute, we weren’t ready to order the zh but he came back offering us the mains he chose (the most expensive dishes) and we told him that we prefer to share something as I don’t eat hard meat and we were not hungry enough. But finally he chose again for us and was a confusing situation because of the rush. After the starters we didn’t know about the main he chose, and when it showed up it was a big meat dish! My partner ate it all and didn’t get impressed at all for a meat dish of that price. My main dish was the meat garnish.

Then I asked for the menu and ordered eggs and bacon on a muffin - which honestly was absolutely dreadful. My bacon wasn't cooked so I had to send it back which I never normally do. They didn't offer to make the whole dish again so when my bacon finally arrived back out which took them 15 minutes for 2 miserable pieces of bacon to be cooked, my eggs had gone completely cold and the whole thing was completely disgusting...

I ordered a Bloody Mary that was probably one of the worst I’ve had given its strong vinegar flavor. But the worst was when my Brandade de Morue was brought to the table—with two eggs on top, one of which somehow managed to have a firmly cooked yolk but runny whites that weren’t fully cooked. I sent it back, explaining the I like my yolks runny, not my whites. I mean who likes runny egg whites for brunch??? I waited a good 15-20 minutes, and what was brought out to me was a shocker: eggs that seem to have been cooked with a flamethrower! The yolks were hard as possible, and the whites were like plastic. Clearly, the coon was miffed or incompetent or both. I explained the matter to the waiter, who was dumbfounded. Luckily, the manager comped this dish, which I wasn’t able to even eat. The potatoes were bland, and the salted cod was completely left out. I expected a delicious brunch but left disappointed and will never return.

There seemed to be a wait staff change going on and we had to wait approximately 10 minutes before a waiter came to our table only to say he was leaving and Miguel would now be our waiter. Miguel come to the table took our drink and food orders. Our drinks arrived and we hardly lifted the glasses of wine and our food arrived. The croque monsieur was soaked in some sort of flour lumpy cheese sauce accompanied by a huge amount of cold greasy frites, the salad came with the dressing on it, the hamburger was charred and also served with cold greasy frites, and the soup was cold. Not what was expected...tried as we may to find Miguel he seemed to have \"left the building\". The parade of suited people carrying iPads never stopped either. Finally Miguel arrived with the bill. He didn\\'t ask how we liked our lunch or if anything was wrong...it was obvious since our plates were half full, that all was not right with our lunch. We paid the bill and left very very disappointed.

The pepper was put down onto the table without a word. The waiters were rushing around and didn’t seem to have the time to tend to customers or to ensure food and comfort was ok.

We got a kid’s quesadilla, a fish sandwich, and a burger.The quesadilla was the best thing of the three. The cheese was melted and the bread was slightly toasty - pretty hard to mess that up. The fish was supposedly furikake encrusted but it was bland and overcooked, very reminiscent of yoga mat texture.The sauce it came with is something you’d expect to buy in a bottle at the grocery store and the bun was dried out.The burger was supposed to be cooked medium but was barely even rare. The side of cole slaw seemed like they mixed mayo with milk and poured it over cabbage. It was disgusting. I never send food back but I did ask them to take the fish off our tab, which they did.

Unfortunately, the food did not hold up to the reviews. I asked the hostess which one was better; prime rib sandwich or brisket sandwich. She directed me to the prime rib. If it is better than the brisket, than the brisket must be awful. The prime rib sandwich was okay. Not the worst sandwich I’ve had, but I wouldn’t say it was good. It was over salted and overcooked. Almost makes me wonder if it was about to turn and that’s why it was the special. Or perhaps I was directed to it because it was $5 more than the brisket. The atmosphere was quiet when I was there, but you can tell it can be a fun place to hang out after a nice ride when it’s busier.

Our daughter kindly researched restaurants for us before we left, we chose the Club A steakhouse based on its fab reviews and were lucky enough (or so we thought) to get a table for Valentines Day. However we were left feeling very disappointed and totally ripped off after our visit. On a positive note the ambience of the place was amazing, it was dark, candle lit, a fresh red rose on each table, valentines balloons and live music from pianist etc, was absolutely perfect for a romantic dinner for two. However we were a little surprised when we were shown to our table and there was a set valentines menu on it, three courses and a glass of champagne for 115 dollars each. As we had received several e mails from the restaurant confirming our booking with no mention of a set menu and nothing on their website to indicate it was a set menu, we were a little disappointed as we had already chosen what we were going to have from the main menu and had a budget of about 200 dollars in mind. However determined not to let it spoil our evening we perused the set menu but again were disappointed by the choice as there was only mushroom soup, calamari and a salad as far as I can recall, none of which we would have chosen if we had another option. We went for the calamari and the soup but the soup tasted of nothing and the calamari was a little chewy, just nothing like the quality which we would have expected based on the reviews of this place. We still thought, let's wait for our steaks as they are bound to make up for the starters. We opted for the fillet mignon , only 10 ounces although on the main menu this would have been 16 ounces and chose the spinach and mac cheese for our sides. Well the sides were pretty awful, sloppy spinach which we couldn't eat and a very mediocre mac & cheese which tasted like it had come from a packet. The steaks were ok inside but mine was burnt on the outside which did affect the overall taste. The feeling of disappointment continued to grow when our trip of desserts arrived, one had melted into a muddy pool, the chocolate brownie (I think it was a brownie) tasted bland and we have no idea what the other was as they all tasted of nothing. The glass of champagne (or prossecco ) was good though). Then the final straw was that other couples who arrived after us were able to order off the main menu and their food looked delicious , I think it was rib eye of beef or something. A waiter kindly pointed out to us that it was a speciality of the house and everyone orders it when they come ! How to rub salt into a wound.... The bill came and at 350 dollars, it kind of took our breath away. I can't believe we both walked out without saying anything at the time but to be honest I think we were kind of numb. However on reflection I think the restaurant just used the occasion to make as much as they could out of their customers. We should have been told of the set menu, we would not have gone if this was the only available menu or we should have been told we could have ordered from the main menu which would have said is 100 plus dollars and perhaps would have resulted in a positive review. I do not review many places, although we travel to many places and eat out at least three times a week, usually only reviewing if it's an amazing experience or in this instance, we have a disappointing experience. I can only assume it was because it was Valentines Day and the restaurant decided to take advantage of this but I'm afraid we would not return to Club A Steakhouse as our experience has left a decidedly bitter taste in our mouths as did the food on the night. Really sorry to have to write such a review but it tainted our whole weekend\", 'An amazing experience!

I have enjoyed ramen from all over the world and this was a poor excuse for flavourless dish water. Considering there was a line out on the street, a very good rating on trip advisor, some articles in the newspaper etc it astounds me how they can be so popular when their food is so appalling. There was no flavour, hardly any vegetables and the restaurant was cheap and nasty. The ramen was so bad, that my 2 friends and I couldn't even eat it. The staff were useless and told us (incorrectly) that all the ramen came with pork so were disappointed when the ramen came out with maggi noodles and a few bean sprouts in tasteless broth. This is not ramen. Quite glad it didn't have pork it it and as I wound trust it anyway. Do yourself a favour and STAY AWAY from Sapporo!\", \"Super tasty food. Wanted to lick the plate.

There were two large chunks of bone with a few scraps of meat of interminable origin on them(possibly chicken but definitely the sort of scraps you would use in a stock and then discard) two prawns and an unopened clam. Even at the relatively cheap cost of 8 Euros a plate it's still poor value for money considering the extremely bad quality of the ingredients.

Dishes that at first appear super simple are, after diving in, deeply complex.

For the first time in I don’t even know how long, I could actually eat the bread!! So that just made it a million times better of course; and we hadn’t even gotten the actual food yet!! Anyways, Ralph triple checked everything and I ended up getting my typical for Italian restaurants, pasta with red sauce and olive oil. Now, let me tell you, this was no ordinary pasta with red sauce. It was so good it made my very particular taste buds dance with happiness, which is a very rare occurrence by the way.

I didn't want to create a fuss and ate it but did say to the waitress that it had been poor. She pretty much shrugged her shoulders. Whilst waiting for our meal the table next to ours complained about the lamb chops - the menu showed a lovely stacked heap of chops but, again, the reality was different.

We wanted to try a few items so we ordered the lamb biryani, naans, and mixed vegetable curry. Here is where the service starts to get shadey. The lamb biryani comes with a side dish of the SAME exact mixed vegetable curry that we ordered, so why couldn\\'t the waiter point that fact out and ask us if this is indeed what we want to order because it\\'s just double of what we have coming? It doesn\\'t hurt to make sure by asking us! What drove the fishy night further is the tipping part.

We ordered the clam chowder, the seafood soup, pan seared scallops, and pan seared cod. The clam chowder was creamy and delicious and the seafood soup, delivered Manhattan style, was flavourful. Unfortunately, these were the only eatable dishes that were served that evening. The scallops were dry as bone and tough as steak while the cod had the texture of rubber. The asparagus that came alongside the cod had been boiled for so long, it had turned to mush. We did not stay for dessert. The ambiance of the restaurant is good and the server, an elderly gentleman, was courteous and friendly.

Deep dish goodness that makes you and your belly happy\", 'Long line, chaotic atmosphere, LOUD music and no place to sit and eat sum up this place. We were in NYC and decided to check out this place based on the reviews as my husband loves Mexican food. We waited in line for over 20 mins breathing in second hand cigarette smoke from inconsiderate German tourists waiting in line, only to be greeted with a loud and chaotic scene in this fast food Mexican restaurant when we walked in. The music was extremely loud and there was only standing room only - no chairs, just a few high tables to stand while eating. Food was so-so, nothing to rave about. This place definitely does not live up to our expectations and does not live up to its hype. I do NOT recommend this place at all. There are many good restaurants in NYC. Skip this place and go eat at a less stressful restaurant with better food and service.', 'Friendly staff, relaxed and chilled atmosphere and great food. Ships looked after us and he and all the staff were amazing. Highly recommend.', 'We have a good dinner with beautiful view in Jin Xuan Restaurant. Seated near window with helpful assistance from Anna makes our dinner a pleasant experience. ', 'Fairly good food, quite bad service.

Delicious, tasteful and plenty of food. Highly recommended!', \"I told the waiter that I was allergic to dairy & gave him a card listing my allergies to show the chef. When my meal was served to me, I took one bite, and had an anaphylactic reaction that I luckily was able to control with benadryl. There was cheese under my fish! The waiter apologized profusely and comped the meal, but had no explanation for why he made such a serious mistake. I'll never return\", 'Very worst taste', 'The service was excellent. Starter, main and dessert were all amazing. I would highly recommend visiting this restaurant during your stay in Istanbul.', \"If you love smorrebrod then you might be quite happy to overlook the pricey offerings at this modern but not particularly well run restaurant. I quite like smorrebrod but also can't quite overlook the various shortcomings, such as the slow pace (during a far-from-hectic lunch service), the stuffy air, and the inattentive staff. The food were good though, and I'd probably come again given the dearth of affordable but interesting options nearby\", 'Worst waitstaff experience ever!

Sat inside and s=asked to be moved away from the door. All no problem for the lovely young staff. Not an extensive menu but enough. Pizzas some of best we had ever had including travels round Italy. They are massive so £15 a pizza not exorbitant. This is mitigated further by BYOB. £1.50 pp and we took wine and beer so really can be quite a cheap night out. We did not have starters or puddings as clocked the size of the pizza. We even too 2 x quarters home with us for breakfast! Will deffo return.

Kimchi and Vegan Ramen with Tofu was a big portion, Steamy hot and comforting on a rainy day. Lovely :) Staff was very friendly. Open kitchen so we can see and smell the goodness.', 'This is hard for me to write as we had a great experience here just a week ago. The staff, most of them at least are strIving to provide excellent service in a time where it is hard enough to get staff. Our server was excellent to say the least. We frequent Huggo’s on the Rocks every year when we are here in Kona and it was definitely one of our favourites until tonight. It seems the management has a new policy that there is a 2 hour time limit on a table. So when we sat we waited 35 minutes for our server to bring us water and take our drink order. This was verified by our server. We told the server we were in no rush and understood they were short on staff. He was very thankful for our patience. When the drinks came there was lipstick on one of the glasses and we pointed it out to him and he immediately took it back and returned a few minutes later with a fresh drink. We had 2 drinks each and an appetizer each. Our server brought our bill and left it on the table which seemed odd but we didn’t question it as we thought maybe it was shift change. We had planned on having dinner as well and were about to order it when someone who I assume was a manger came to our table and told us that we were approaching the 2 hour time limit that they had for tables. We we’re flabbergasted to say the least as we had just spent the previous Sunday with friends who were also locals and we enjoyed the whole evening which probably ended up being about 4 or 4.5 hours. Also noticed that there were several tables and people there long before us that were not being thrown out. Some of these were Ohana of the band which is understandable but not sure why us in particular. There were also at least three empty tables we noticed as we left. Great staff lousy management and this is definitely not the Aloha Spirit. Terribly disappointed.', 'The food was exquisitely but what made the experience even more enjoyable was our waitress ,Maria. She was absolutely brilliant a real gem. She answered all of our questions , recommended wine and food as well. If there is one going , she should certainly get promoted.', 'Overall, a very good meal in a very atmosphere with good service. However, none of the elements were top notch. Two dishes arrived within minutes of ordering, even before we have received our drinks. Then a large gap before the next dishes arrived. The food was ranging from excellent (Aubergine Mess) to odd (Venison Shank). Some of the dishes were inspired, but the Venison Shank did not fit in as it was served with gravy on a rösti with a small herbal salad. Given the location in an arch, the acoustics are not great. We were seated upstairs and it seems that their open kitchen downstairs lead to our clothes smelling of cooking after our visit.', 'The restaurant was far from crowded, still it took almost an hour from ordering until the food was on our table. Speaking of tables, none was cleared/cleaned eventhough the guests had left half an hour earlier. It seems like a huge lack of communication among the staff, our waiter did hardly not understand swedish nor english ', 'Not the best, booked a table and they tryed sitting us at the bar facing the smelly hot kitchen.

The service is incredibly poor, provided by inept waiters who do not make the effort to dress smartly, one of which did not wear his face mask covering his nose and we watched him remove it when away from customers.

The head waiter had the cheek to bring our change back to the table then assume he was being given it all as a tip, removing it from the table .

No apologies, no explanation as to the delay, even when people whom had subsquently arrived after our party were served before us (and indeed, take outs were prioritised). In total, we received our order almost an hour after arriving. All of which was disappointing. The pizzas were nice enough but nothing that you could not have obtained from a take away.

That was me upset, not even with raised tones, but she found it funny! And she proceeded to cut the call. This is beyond abysmal and cheap!

There\\'s another red lobster close by I\\'d recommend driving the extra bit to go to. My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel close to sea world and as a surprise I wanted to take him out to red lobster. We go to red lobsters all the time and this experience almost turned me away from them all together. They had so many people waiting, there was like a group of 20 which they couldn\\'t control. I\\'ll give them that they got us seated quickly(only two of us). That\\'s when we got seated in the worst section possible between that group of 20 and the crying kids and babies it was far from relaxing. The waitress we had (Jade S.) Was by far the worse server I\\'ve ever had anywhere. McDonald\\'s would\\'ve had better service than this place. She comes to our table sits down on the opposite side and basically just asks what our order and drinks are. And then just sits there complaining about the the group of 20. She gets up to get our drinks and comes back 20 minutes later with our drinks. We go through our drinks waiting for the biscuits that come with his entree(a standard at red lobster) she comes back through asks if he wants a refill since his cup was empty ignoring my empty cup. Comes back another 10 minutes later with his refill then asks if we \"ya know want biscuits since they come with the entree\" 50 minutes later after we\\'ve sat down, still ignoring my refill order. Keep in mind she has barely been serving us or the huge group she complained of she kept disappearing to the back and we wouldn\\'t see her. She finally had someone else bring out the biscuits and his drink and that waitress asks me if I want a refill. I said yes please. She said they have to make my raspberry tea at the bar Jade S brings my drink and it\\'s some kind of lemonade. Then someone from the back brings out our food. The food was fine normal red lobster mine was a little burnt on the bottom(lobster pizza) but his was fine or so he said. I honestly wanted to get the manager but we were so tired after working all day(work in the sun) and just wanted to get the hell out of there we asked for our check. She said okay brought it up 15 or so minutes later then waited another 10 minutes to get my card back and sign the check. By far the worst experience at a red lobster ever. I will never come back here. We spent about 2 hours just waiting for food and refills on drinks we gave up on getting refills after the second time. Red Lobster corporate needs to do a serious retraining of the staff here. The only one to look like he knew anything was the wait or serving the section next to us. His tables never went without refills or biscuits and food was out within 20-30 mins. This was a truly unacceptable way to handle any situation.', 'Absolute gem, we have now stayed twice at the hotel for a weekend away and can only compliment the team on a fantastic all round service. The food and of course the beer are simply top class. We look forward to many more visits in the future!', \"We went there for a late lunch. The service was quite OK. We ordered two croque monsieurs and one chicken and bacon baguette. The baguette tasted fine but the croque monsieurs ordered were absolutely horrible. First of all, they came as croque madames (with the addition of an egg). Normally, when ordering a croque monsieur/madame, you'd expect it to be a nicely toasted two slices of bread with ham and cheese. The sandwiches were cold from the inside, had no taste at all and were very dry. Plus the eggs were boiled as well as cold and not fried like they are supposed to be. A sign of laziness, to be frank. The bread was four slices of thick, tasteless bread which made the portion so huge that I could eat only half of it. The salad tasted like a ready mix from the bag.

As a conclusion for the amount of money you are going to pay it's not worth it at all or at least on this occasion the service has ruined completely the experience.\", 'Never ever in my life have I eaten food so badly made. Dingy and dark. I think this restaurant is cover for a doggy business. Food is horrible, tasteless and overpriced. Avoid by all means', 'Dinner was delicious... and service was excellent! We were seated ( with reservation) immediately being greeted warmly by our server. He was happy t suggest the specialities of the restaurant and help us make choices.

Terrible terrible terrible', 'Just like my title says, I just don’t understand how this place is rated so high? I came in for lunch by myself to see if this location was better then the Chelsea store, and to no surprise it’s not. To start of with the cashier who is just not hospitable at all, then you are given a ticket that you need to present to the guy who makes your taco. He literally shouts at you CORN or FLOUR! I at first had no idea what he meant and when I asked him to explain he became mad and rudely said “type of Tortilla, do you understand now?” Come on, that’s just ridiculous. After receiving my tacos, one steak one pork, there was literally no difference in taste at all. These tacos are slammed together so fast all with the same ingredients, taste is an after thought. I would not of done the one star but the treatment from the staff just ruined it. I don’t recommend.', 'Everything is ABOVE SATISFACTORY. Perfect!

Most importantly, it's delicious. \", 'Service is appalling time after time. Have to ask to be served each time. Food came at different times. Kids mains came first and they forgot starters.

And then had to ask for the bill twice.', \"It's aight, service is kinda low for a non crowded restaurant. Food was aight although it took over an hour to get. \", \"Even though the food was good, it was way overpriced and the waiter scammed us. We should have known when the other restaurants were packed and we were the only ones here. We had reindeer meatballs with lingonberries (3 of them) and the charcuterie tray. The charcuterie tray was supposed to be 40 SEK per person and they charged us 370 SEK! I was trying to question the bill and the waiter took it out of my hand and crumbled it up. He said the bill I need is the credit card charge. We didn't want to argue since we weren't going to get anywhere but buyer BEWARE! If you choose to eat here, take a picture of the menu prices and check your bill very carefully.

The pork knuckle was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Each dish was without a doubt intricately planned to compliment each element within the dish. Staff were friendly and very hospitable. Overall great experience!', 'I find it very overrated, quite expensive and not comfortable.

Hands down the most unique pizza you can get in the Bay Area. So many different styles to choose from! Oh and don't forget about the pasta. I think the pesto here, is the best pesto I have ever had in my life. The Burrata Queen was immaculate! I love cheese, and I love pesto. Put that on a pizza, and my life is made!

Went downstairs to eat which is a modest but functional space, so fine, and there are a few seats by the entrance too. A very nicely prepared, healthy and filling meal - I didn't need anything else after this. You're spoilt for choice regarding eating places on Goodge Street and in the Fitzrovia area, but you can't go wrong here if you like this kind of food, and who doesn't. Exceptional value too.\", 'We went to the Red Lobster tonight and were so disappointed with the quality of the food and poor timing. We ordered a chicken taco, lobster taco and two rock lobsters. The chicken in the taco didn’t taste very nice, was dry and was heavily processed. The lobster taco was dry and both tacos were not shells as advised but were tortilla wraps. The rock lobsters were again dry, salty and we couldn’t taste the lobster. The sides were wrong, my daughter was given a side of mashed potato as well as a jacket potato, and my son never received his broccoli. We ordered by 7.50pm and eventually received dinner at 9.10pm!

Highly recommended.', \"I went here with decent expectations but was quickly met with reality. The food was average and overpriced. The burger was small and overpriced. There was nothing that really stood out. I'd place it at the same level as In and Out, Hat Creek, Mighty Fine...in fact as far as taste, Mighty Fine is much better and fresher. I thought maybe a shake would be a saving grace for the meal but nope. Just another shake...I'd go as far to say that a Chick-fil-A shake was better and less expensive.\", \"Great greasy spoon restaurant! I will come again. We need more of these type restaurants for quick breakfast service. This isn't a Keke's or First Watch but the food is good. My only suggestions would be to serve all of the food at the same time, don't cut up the French toast/pancakes and make sure that all the food comes out hot! I will try lunch next time.😉\", 'Stopped off at the end of a day exploring Munich. Good atmosphere, stopped for a beer, stayed for supper. Wide variety of Bavarian food and drink on the menu; served quickly and with little fuss. Would recommend if you want good choice and value.', \"Very disappointing food, even for less money. Buffalo mozzarella was nice, but it was just good choice of the cheese. No value or beauty added by chef. Chicken was so plain, no beauty on the plate - nothing extraordinary in taste. For 5 euros would be ok for a quick lunch. And the super sweet cream they serve under name cream Catalan is far from the original dessert. Service was super quick, even too quick to enjoy the food.

Reception managed to get the executive chef on the phone who was able to describe in detail how and where prep work is done, which items contain diary and some personal experience modifying menu items to accomodate. Upon arrival a kitchen manager was the highest ranking staff present who contradicted the level of local versus processed prep work done in the restaurant and made several incorrect assumptions about what is dairy (eggs, gluten).

We loved their full English breakfast, variations on this, breakfast sandwiches, rolls if you're less hungry, homemade/house special hot sauce, & jacket potatoes.

I wouldn' say it is bad, but would not taste the difference with a kanelbulle from the supermarket. It didn't taste fresh (I picked it up at 9 am in the morning, so possible thawed instead of being freshly baked), and quite bland.If you want to eat the biggest kanelbulle in your life and love quantity above fresh quality, come here.

She advised avoiding fries due to a lack of control over what else would have been fried in the oil.

For appetizers we had shrimp special and potstickers. Both were very good and shareable. Now crap hits the fan. Out of 8 dinners, 5 were steaks and they got one right. 1 came as others were literally have finished, one filet was ordered MW and came MR. Then was ask to cook up a little and came back when all but late dinner was finished. Other was served extra Rare. Well onto the icing on the cake! We ordered desserts an coffee.

We drove from Jersey to Boston and figured we couldn't leave without having some New England lobster. I should have known better after drinking that horrible tap water. Clam chowder tasted more like watered down celery chowder. Ordered the lobster which came with potatoes and a corn. The loster smelled, looked and tasted old. The lobster meat was so hard we were not able to chew. In all honesty, the corn was the best part of the meal. Service was a little slow, guess because it was crowded.

Two girls who were in there were clearly on drugs , falling all over the place and into their food, splling drinks and were just totally out of it.

I would definitely reccomend this to others as the food was great and so was the atmosphere.', 'Customer service was superb. David was our waiter and he was polite, efficient, chatty, fast and professional. Top top guy. My 7yo ordered apple juice and the wife some bubbles. David whispered to me whether he could serve my 7yo her apple juice in a Prosecco glass. She was over joyed having a grown up glass. Little attention to deal matters, especially when the place was full and all waiting staff were rushed off their feet.', 'This was the worst we have ever been treated in a Malmö restaurant. We\\'ve been here a hundred times over the years with our lovely dog, since they have outsdie seating. They have always been friendly.

Wine tasted as it was opened for a while and it was actually tasteless and flavorless.', 'Outstanding customer service and gorgeous food!', 'Very affordable lunch prices!

Waitress very polite and helpful,', 'Just had a few days in New York and as we visited here a few years ago, we wanted to dine here again. The first visit was just my wife and I, this time we went with my brother and his wife as we told them they will not have a steak anywhere better than Club A. The whole dining experience is absolutely first class, from being greeted and throughout the whole evening. The service is spot on, the food is perfection. If you want a memorable evening dining out, this is the only place to go. We couldn’t recommend this restaurant highly enough. In a word “Perfect “', '\\xa0We had to ask for more parmesan for our pasta because it was so bland and they charged us extra. We both felt a bit sick after. Go somewhere better', 'Overall the steakhouse has gotten great reviews-which is why we went. Maybe we just went on a bad night (although one would think that Saturday evening shouldn\\'t be an off night), but the steaks were anything but \"prime cuts.\" The meal was overall extremely disappointing-I have purchased better quality steaks at Walmart grocery. Service however was excellent.', \"Went with a work colleague for lunch here and while the food was tasty, found the service below par for the price - around £85 for two people. Drinks were fast but the starter took 10-15 minutes to be served, then my lunch main came 30-minutes later, then my colleague's main came 20-30 minutes later only after we asked the waiter where it was (seems like it was forgotten). Not sure if they were short-staffed that day but wasn't impressed. \", \"When in TriBeCa, have dinner at Marc Forgione restaurant, you won't regret it. Go for the foie gras for starters. Next, we had chicken to share and it was so delicious. Don't worry, you will have plenty. Service was excellent and ambiance was great. It's not cheap but worth every penny.\", 'If this is, based on other reviews - probably by tourists - the “best pizza of Milan” I’d rather go to McDonald’s ... my review of their “Calabria” titled pizza: lack of nduja, hardly any ingredients, salty and excessively tall base - never again ...', \"Having visited Kanishka on a number of occasions, we were excited to try out Atul's new restaurant. We were not disappointed. As always the service was excellent and the food was delicious. The menu offered an interesting range of dishes that all had the amazing flavour combinations that Atul does so well. The venue has been sensitively converted retaining some original features whilst creating a welcoming atmosphere. We will be back!\", \"4 stars for the ambience and the courtesy of the staff! The staff are quite welcoming and knowledgable about the menu and can give you some good advice on the drinks and food. During my visit, they started off by saying the list of things they didn't have on the menu which was a bit disappointing considering it was a Friday evening at 19.45 and not later in the night so we ended up just doing the drinks and starters and not the main course. The drinks are ok I would say. The server recommended a cocktail which she said would be really strong with a whiskey base but it turned out to be a cranberry drink with some whiskey in it (so was the opinion from my wife). Some of the other cocktails were good though. Starters, on the other hand were outstanding and completely palate satisfying. Overall I would recommend the place more because of the ambience as the drinks and food are like any other similar restaurant.\", \"i had eaten at mon ami gabi several times and on both coasts when my allergies were *just* gluten and dairy. this was the first time when they had expanded to gluten/grain/dairy/soy. we were in las vegas for a quick trip and decided to head there for lunch. our server was a lovely lady who knew the menu, asked if i had celiac and double checked with the chef anyway. i started off ordering a basic salad with salmon on the side. i mentioned off hand that their fries had been my favorite anywhere before having to go gf and she told me they had a separate fryer and if i wanted some she would check with the chef if i could eat them. i caved. all of my food came out with allergy sticks in them and everything tested happy with my nima. i highly recommend. and if you are at this vegas location, try and go early, you can sit on the patio and watch the bellagio fountains (they don't take reservations for the patio).\", \"One of the best bowl's of ramen I have had.

My twins have PN and TN allergies and ate there safely.  The food was really good!  ', 'Excellent service. We sat down at a booth and I asked if we could move to a table with softer lighting. The waiter immediately went to the back and dimmed the lighting just a little. It was perfect! The wine servings were very generous!

I will certainly recommend it to my friends!', \"Lip smacking delicious breakfast. Veg and non veg, variety of options are available in both category. I loved their creamy smooth scrambled egg, the best chicken sausages and the variety of European breads and croissanta are incredible. South Indian and north India food options are also available and are pure temptation. Add to this pasta and dimsums, and you are done for the day. These are the ones I tried. There's more to explore! Oh don't forget the fresh fruits and nuts served with filter coffee and tea. Overall rating: 20/10 (yeah it's that good).\", 'My husband and I stopped by this cafe for a break from touring the city in September 2017. The Haga District is a cool artistic area full of interesting restaurants and fun shops.The cafe had seating indoors and outside. We found a comfy seat inside and ordered two cappuccinos and one GIANT cinnamon roll to share. It was a deliciously humongous version of the famous kanelbullar. We enjoyed the tasty treat and relaxing atmosphere. A nice stop for a sugar and caffeine break!', \"Each course was cold and uninspiring. Despite being given specific instructions, they spelled my wife's name incorrectly when writing it across her dessert.\", 'We will never go back there. We were told waiting time 45min, which was fine for us. But we saw several tables open. Asked 30min later, then the lady said high tables were first comes first. Could let us know about that earlier? Then, seated, ordered salad and burger. More than 30min wait, asked if they forgot about our food. Server said 45min-1hr wait for food. Could let us know about that?! Seriously?! What kind of customer service is that?', \"Dry burgers, almost no sauce in it. I ordered one with onions. Very annoying that you have to order extra sides... you don't for example get fries with your burger. The staff was so unprofessional and rude. I felt ill after I ate the burger.

Excellent service, value for money but the highlight of the day was their delicious huge cinnamon bun. Definitely a place to go to when you're visiting Gothenburg.\", 'They have tasty big cinnamon buns and a variety of sandwiches and pies. the coffee is very good and the place is very traditional and cosy.', 'The settings and the restaurant is quite nicely decorated. However, to my surprise nor the toilets were really clean, nor the distance with the other guests was in my opinion close to the recommendations provided by the Swedish Health Institute. What was even worse was the waiting time. After waiting 10 minutes to order, we received the drinks quite fast, but we had to wait nearly 1 hour for 3 pizzas.

So sweet.', 'The food is not taste at all and it’s pricey. Staff don’t understand English well.', 'I had dinner at La Pescheria and was impressed with the service, atmosphere, and food. The main dining room is small and quaint, but they have a conservatory as well. I selected the seafood soup and the staff were happy to suggest wine pairings. The seafood in the soup was fresh and well cooked, not at all rubbery as one can experience with this type of dish. The tomato base was flavorful and rich, without smothering the fish and other seafood allowing them to be the star of the dish. The staff were always available without hovering and the service was outstanding. This was an excellent choice!!', 'Such a wide variety of pierogies to choose from, but all are amazing and unique. Worth the wait to eat here!', 'We ordered mocktail drink pairings, and these did not come when it’s dishes arrived. This should have been timed better. The waitors that served the drinks spoke too quiet and unclear so it was difficult to hear what they were saying.', \"I'd heard a lot about Cafe Husaren and their famous plate sized cinnamon buns, Hagabullen, when I was researching the city of Gothenburg before I moved here.I'm glad to say it more than lived up to the hype, the prices were reasonable, the interior is gorgeous and the food is great. Hagabullen and Coffee at Cafe Husaren has become a weekend staple for me.Like all coffee in Sweden, the brewed coffee is strong and flavourful and the food I've had has been equally satisfying. The Hagabullen, alleged to be the world's largest cinnamon bun, is baked in the cafe and is served warm in store. I'd recommend getting one to share, but I have been able to finish one on my own before. The pastry is not too dense and the cinnamon filling is just the right level of sweet. I've also had the Blueberry Pie, which was sweet, tart and came with a lovely custard.Husaren is a popular cafe, so I'd recommend getting there early if you want a seat inside.\", 'First time in this place, we will definitely come back soon!

My daughter and I were there for lunch. The service was great, as we had a very friendly waitress. I had fish and chips, which was one big piece of haddock. I was afraid I would be sick if I ate the entire piece because the fish was EXTREMELY greasy.

Very good coffee and tea. Cafeteria-style line. Friendly, professional staff.On a return trip to Goteborg, we stopped in a few time to this delightful place, known for the biggest cinnamon buns in town (yes -- SHARE them.) In fact, many items can be shared, including the very large coconut macaroon. The other pastries and light lunch sandwiches are also very good. Reasonable prices for very good quality.There is a range of coffee, teas, bottled beverages, and I THINK I remember bottled beer, but I;m not sure about that. At lunch and fika (pastry and coffee break time for Swedes,) I stick with coffee and tea.The set-up is a cafeteria-style line where you can see what is on offer. If it looks like a busy time, I suggest a tag-team where someone can hold a table for you. It's not always THAT busy, but it is a popular place.There are outdoor tables for warmer weather, or even cooler months when the sun is out (there were a few days like that in January, and the pedestrain street is fairly sheltered in this area.)Definitely use this place to bolster tourself for the great shopping at small shops inthe Haga area!It's also rather atmospheric to be in a cozy room with chandeliers.\", \"This TGI's was fine. Staff were friendly and attentive and our food was of good quality and enjoyed by all.\", \"We went on Father's Day for a meal and rounded the price of our meal up for the tip, ok it wasn't what they asked for, but there was no need to add on money to make it higher. As far as I'm concerned the people at red lobster have stolen money from myself. If u add on a tip then that is the amount that should be taken out the bank not what every they want to take. So if you pay on card don't leave a tip or it won't be what u have written down. Last time will ever visit.\", 'We ordered the mussels they were lacking flavor , the calamari was \\xa0soggy and the Paella tasted like it had been sitting there for quite some Time before they served it to us.

Everything was delicious.', 'Got a ceasar salad made with chicken so \"well done\" and dry it was hard to swallow (and also without spices) The salad part was mostly rocket salad and instead of bread crumbs there were some small bread sticks. Not even worth eating ; left most of it. Also we ordered olives and garlic bread to eat before the meal. Got the olives with the food after asking for them. Got one piece of garlic bread after reminding them again. Tried two tables - both very instable. A waitress was nice and put something under the second table to fix it.

The plates were cold, the staff was not very pleasant and the food gave us upset stomachs. The bill was then given to us without even asking for it and was literally thrown down on the table in a very rude manner. We were then told the restaurant was going to close at 11pm so we had to leave. This was not stated anywhere in the restaurant nor on the website. We were extremely disappointed.

Rest of the veggie thali was alright. They brought out a lamb curry instead of a okra curry- we didn’t challenge on this because it already took close to an hour to get the food out.

This is a corporate restaurant (Back Bay Restaurant Group - Joe\\'s American Bar and Grill, Papa Razzi, Abe & Louie\\'s, Coach Grille, and the defunct Bouchee and J.C. Hillary\\'s).

Was escorted upstairs to a window seat which was beautiful. The restaurant has great ambiance. After that is was like watching a ship sink fast. The service was terrible. We ordered a moscow mule for a cocktail which was the same as we ordered downstairs with very specific intstructions. When it came it was something completley different, we told the sever that it was wrong once he decided to show up at our table again. He brought literlly the exact same drink back to us. We left it and drank the water.

Holiday season resulted in a big crowd and the I felt they were under staffed. Despite that, we enjoyed our food and loved the experience! We were sharing the table with two other guests and made some new friends!', 'This was the worst dining experience of my recent 8 night Boston and Maine trip. Definitely took a long time to get drinks after we ordered. Started with the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. It was a horrible presentation of mostly greens and instead of slices of roasted beets they were practically raw and shredded into the greens. You could not even taste the beets only knew you had one when it crunched in your teeth. The sides served with our main dishes were room temperature not at all hot or close to warm. Our waitress never came back to see how our dinner was so we had to flag down another server. They sent over a manager who asked if we wanted new dishes. 20 minutes went by with no food, no apology, no offer of a glass of wine or cocktail while we waited. Our waitress passed our table 4-5 times never once saying a word to us! I asked her why and she said “ my manager said she’s taking care of it” Terrible service!! The manager asked if I wanted sauce with my swordfish which the waitress never asked. The swordfish was dry, fishy and a very small portion for the price. Manager said it’s a 5 oz portion? Maybe that’s OK for lunch but I would expect a larger portion for $37 at dinner. When 3/4 of the plate is mashed potatoes and spinach something is not right! My husband’s crab topped haddock was also over cooked. We live in Florida and go to Abe and Louie’s in Boca all the time and expected the same high quality food and service here. Not even close!

Really advise against eating there.\", \"Some people deal with high demand (which induces stress, no doubt) by smiling and patiently explaining the seating situations.

However..... It was not mind blowing, the price was and the bill was inaccurate. A bad combination! After the group had ordered, I suddenly remembered a starter that was all of a sudden essential! I spoke to the very accommodating waiter and ordered a number of the same starter. When the starters were delivered, they were not the starters ordered and when this was raised with the waiter I was told that I had ordered it! It was really insulting to be lied to my face after I challenged the order. I would not recommend nor revisit this restaurant which is a shame because the food and general service was good. But trying to take advantage of a group of (not as inebriated as they thought!) people was really disappointing. Bad show Eastern Eye! Spend your money elsewhere peeps', 'Really enjoyed this place.

They charge £3 extra for rice, which usually comes along with dishes at other curry places. When I tried to order a main dish with no rice, the waiter laughed at me. The portion of chicken that came out (for £12) ended up being quite small and I walked out still hungry (and it tasted average). I also got a generally weird vibe from the staff that creeped us all out. Never coming back.', \"My daughter ordered a burger. Our server brought her a burger sans bun because he wanted to recheck with us before he placed the burger on the bun as the buns contained sesame.

There are other Indian restaurant like Indian Bistro and Himalaya who are much much better. We went there for lunch at 2:35 pm as the closing time was 3 pm. They said they are closing soon, so we said that it's fine we will got to some other restaurant. Then they said it's ok and agreed to give paneer masala instead of three different dishes as we have done the same in Indian bistro. what we got was paneer spinach (inspite of telling them that we dont eat spinach) and when we brought this , then the women there started yelling at us that we did a favour to you by serving lunch as it was closing time. And we gave you extra dish instead of palak paneer which is a complete lie. and also said you took so many biscuits because of our indian mentality. We took biscuits as the kid won't eat any lunch but why do we have to explain it if it was included. They took away all the salad also so that we can't take any. About taste: this is not because we had a personal bad experience but genuinely as a food enthusiast, lover (and I cook alright myself) I can say it was the worst food I had in any restaurant period. In Gothenburg or anywhere else. The Naan were soft inspite of telling them that make them crisp. The chicken gravy had a taste which i can't describe. vegetarian items were of bad taske they mixed all the beans which is no Indian/Asian dish. All the item were sweet including mint chutney which was a new thing for me. They don't know how to treat their customer. So visit if you are ready to can risk your self esteem.\", 'The food was terrible, pasta overcooked, fish with NO taste, service The price is too high for what they offer. I don’t recommend it', \"Not what it used to be. Menu has changed and the service has really gone down hill. The wait for a table can be over and hour on the weekends.

Must say the reviews were good as well.I went there with 2 friends and my sister, as a respect to her BF who just visited NY for the first time. We had reservations so we didn't wait at all, we set kinddda in the middle so it was a bit loud. It was also very dark, I couldn't understand if it was for the need of drama or trying to save on electricity bill...Anyway, food- I ordered a steck and a side of asparagus and shared a side of Mac and cheese with my sister, it was supposed to be an appetizer but it came along with the food, mistakes - we all do them it's fine... We had to open with their braed platter that was very fine.You would think, how can you ruin asparagus plate? Or a nice piece of stack? Well yeah you can, very easily.The stack was dry to death, I asked medium, there was nothing medium about it.The Mac and cheese had more oil than the oil tank the fry the French fries in, it was a short way to painful heartburn.The poor asparagus was soaked with oil as if it was water. So even if you wanted to get a little bit health from eating veggies, nope you can't.The waitress realize something was wrong but he was very busy and I choose not to bother him with that, after all it seemed like a pattern.He gave us samples of 3 desserts, it's the first time that I could stick to my word of skipping dessert. Not cause I wanted, cause it was horrible. We got some type of dough dipped in guess what?! Yup! Oil! Some cake that I guess was supposed to be a cheesecake, but it wasn't. A dissaster!So why 2 starts after all? The service.The Service was rally wonderful! You can see that the waitres work there for many years, they know what they need to do, and they were really nice. They deserve it all.Don't think I'll ever go back to this stack house, at least not when I worry about the amount of oil I'm consuming.\", 'Amazing service from Sophie who catered to all our needs and made us feel very welcome. Delicious food and cocktails. I’ve been here a couple of times before and had been put off by the service - the waiters/waitresses had been a little brash and would a frequently come to the table to remind us of our time limit on there (even from the start of the meal) - I appreciate that this may be because they have a high turnover, but it detracted from the enjoyment of the meal as I had felt rushed, with drinks being taken from the table before we’d finished them.

Downstairs there is seating near the coffee bar and in the back of the shop. Upstairs there is more of a loungey seating area with couches, tables, etc..

I would definitely go back!\", 'State of Art dining experience <3 Amazing flavours and vibe, one of my fav places in town. ', \"Great location and great food! I went to Ben Thai on a Saturday night and they were able to accommodate a party of 5 without any issue. I tried the khao soi, pad see ew, roasted duck curry, keow wan, and roti. The roasted duck curry was the standout -- aromatic, creamy, and flavorful. Portions are generous, and prices are reasonable. If you're looking for a cozy and casual restaurant on Polk, Ben Thai is a great option!\", 'Ramen lovers, don’t miss a chance to try this place out. Very cool interior. The place looks like a tiny street somewhere in Japan. Delicious authentic ramen + friendly service. 5/5', 'Not a lot of innovation or subtlety here. Upbeat, though generic environment. Three poor wines recommended by our server. Possibly worst fish I’ve ever had - branzino whole-grilled and de-boned with lemon. Was perhaps a few ounces of fleshy, tasteless, sardine- like fish. Everything else mediocre or unassuming. I don’t enjoy writing negative reviews, but this cannot rank as the TOP seafood restaurant in Boston in Trip Advisor - can it?', 'Nothing particularly positive about the whole trip unfortunately. The staff were friendly but other than that the whole experience was quite poor. The starters were overpriced, cold/lukewarm and clearly re-heated bulk bought products (gyoza, miso soup and tempura mushrooms - very greasy). The lettuce/salad accompanying this was brown and wilting. The menu itself is quite poor, not really authentic Japanese food and more like a poor takeaway menu. They had no tofu at all so that was a bit of a nightmare as therefore nearly all the vegetarian dishes were out the window.', 'Awesome experience! I had some last minute changes and it was well accommodated and much appreciated!! It was my brothers birthday and he thoroughly enjoyed the tasty treats \\xa0Great food and amazing customer service!!', 'What a wonderful experience! The porterhouse steak was delicious and the service was amazing. It made us feel very special. Thx so much Bruno & staff!', 'I ordered a poke bowl with salmon, spicy tuna and kimchi, unlike what you see in the photo that you could see clearly which ingredient is what, everything all mixed up in a weird spicy sauce. The kimchi is stale with a weird sour taste, I also ordered a chowder and that yikes as well. Does not recommend poke from here.', 'Dinner was nice enough and the waitress was impeccable. However, for that bill I would expect a) decent portions b) not to be shovelled out in one hour. ', 'I had been Club A several years prior on a family trip and was hoping that it would be as memorable for my girlfriend getaway. Club A did not disappoint. We had the fried calamari appetizer which was crispy and tender. Three of us ordered the filet and one had the bone in strip. The flavor and tenderness of the steaks was hands down the best we have ever had. Our service was fabulous also. And at the end we were treated with a dessert sampling welcoming us all back to NYC.', 'Fabulous happy hour! Totally worked with where we wanted to be seated and it actually was recommended by a friend who used to live in the area.', 'It was a great evening spent at the Fire lake Grill restaurant in damac, the terrace ambience was perfect for watching live football, though our team did not win. The food was one of the best not to forget the warm and hospitable service provided by Sanju.', 'very friendly staff. good drinks and delicious food. Good atmosphere and top location :) absolutely worth ist.', 'Great view but terrible service and overpriced.. 20€ for 0.4 juice is too much.. owners where sitting on terrace and listening something on their phone.. no cards only cash.. handwriten bill.. terrible..', 'Best food on the whole place of gothenburg definitely recommended', 'Great location, well furnished and decorated. Fresh raw materials and very good tastes that allows a customer to experience the Scandinavian kitchen (caviar, reindeer) in well prepared and presented dishes. Service is impeccable and food is well supported by interesting choices of wines.', 'Great place for Indian food lovers. The place was full and we wanted a table. The staff were helpful in arranging a table for us. Excellent service headed by a hospitable captain.', \"Very hyped up restaurant. But to get to the nitty gritty.1. Far too many waiting staff, all of whom knew you were there but ignored you anyway!2. A waiter that came every few seconds with water that we did not want, but explained he would get in trouble if he did not dispense it.I spoke to who looked liked head waiter and explained we didn't want to be consumed with the stuff and that seemed to satisfy him!! Bizarre.3. Food. Well this is a Biggy. Rated so well in New York, we were expecting the stars quite frankly. But what we received were. One well done steak (requested) but extremely dry and what appeared to be crusted with salt?4. Lobster ravioli that was so dry it was almost inedible! You simply cannot cook lobster more than once.The sauce that covered it did what it was supposed to, cover the fact it was so dry! Dreadful.5. To cut a long story short. Tomato and mozzarella salad we didn't order (and not everyone likes, my hubby included!)A dessert, we didn't order either. Again, bizarre. A mixture of cheesecakes, profiteroles etc. again, don't presume, either that we like it, or want it. Complementary or not!!A terrible disappointment, being as we'd been trying to book this for months, given its rating.Advice, should you want any?There are so many extremely better places to eat here.\", 'One starter was not cooked properly and was sent back only to arrive back after one main course was served.', 'Great food, busy for a Wednesday night!', 'The stock fish, a local Monegasque dish, was excellent!!! Couldn’t have enough of it. The hostess was incredibly friendly that we stayed a bit longer after our meal to talk to her about her time in Malaysia! She’s got incredible stories about that.', \"we had an extremely scattered and poor male waiter. My lunch arrived rather quickly but in portions. More than 45 minutes later, my husband's meal came. Several other diners were also having problems with this same waiter, who was unresponsive and sadly should find another occupation.\\xa0\", 'Amazing restaurant in an old cellar with old arches. Good food, nice personal and a very good service.', 'Food was amazing, to the point we have rebooked for next month. Great service, staff were super friendly went out of their way to make our experience a memorable one.', 'Stood at the entrance for five minutes with no employees to be seen. Once seated, almost no eye contact from the three employees, rarely visited my table. Others were shouting and waving their hands to get someone to take their order. The food was OK, And the server was nice once he finally arrived, but such neglect of the customer deserves to be mentioned.', 'Abrupt, rude waiter really spoilt this visit. When I attempted to order what we wanted to drink i was told in an aggresive manner \" You are going to have to wait as i am taking time to catch up on other orders!\" To which he then marched off and we were left for 15 mins or so until he was ready, without a drink but yet a basket of bread was thrown on our table, it nearly toppled off.. We had the Boucherie Burger which was borderline warm, it had been sitting for a while is my guess. the fries were under cooked and for $29 just absolutely shocking .. The Pinot Noir was good and to be honest I\\'d rather sit at the bar and have a drink than ever to eat there again if I had to return to this establishment. Such a disappointment.', 'I waited for 25 minutes server finally brought water waited another 10 minutes and then I left the service is awful. ', \"We came here for afternoon tea, to celebrate a special occasion. I had pre-booked to ensure the restaurant knew our diatory requirements. The staff were professional, welcoming and excellent with attention to detail. A stunning deep red, fresh floral centrepiece adorned the table, which was a truly thoughtful gesture. They also created a beautiful pink 'congratulations' platter with petite cakes. We had different types of teas including gluten free, pescetarian and meat. The ingredients were fresh, tasty and well presented. Three of us had champagne. The cost was £120 and worth every penny. l would certainly recommend the Aria to others. The ambience was also calming and very attractive.\", \"Poor service.  Waitress brought out toast then ten minutes later cold plates of food.  Didn't refill drinks. She took another 10 minutes to give us same plates warmed up. Totally disappointed.\", \"The worst experience in Turkey. The food was tasteless. The staff was not hospitable. The bill was amplified and when we asked about this raise they told us that it was the service fee. It's a scam\", \"My wife took me here for my birthday as we love NY steakhouses.Sorely disappointed from the moment we walked in.Cocktail ordered, didnt arrive for 25mins. Wine list ... very short and very little champagnes.Order 2 steaks, my wife's was overcooked and mine was overcooked and worse still cold.We told them we were Gluten free yet they still brought us bread! and then brought us a plate of deserts... we asked if they were GF ... they said NO. So why bring them to us ?? To tease us! Very poor! Could have munched them and been gluten poisoned!Mortons, Strip House, Lincoln Sq ... so many good Steakhouses in NYC .... this is not one!\", 'They put on the table what you do not order, do not speak English, you deny, they come back again and  waitress talk in Thai. They até NOT honest. My worst experience.', 'My first visit, and absolutely love everything about this place. Excellent food, comfortable surroundings, probably some of the best panoramic views of London, and staffed by some very nice people who clearly work very hard accommodating everyone. I am already looking forward to my next visit.', 'Came with my friend to celebrate and we were offered a glass of prosecco! The fillet steak was one of the best we have ever had. The tuna was top! Great service and great food', 'Had to go find a waiter 2 times for service. Had 5 different waiters, none of them seemed to have things under control. Food was mediocre and we had to cancel our dessert after 30 min of waiting. Extra annoying to see the staff hanging with friends at the bar while at work while we needed service.', 'Great outside space with comfy seating perfect for a long lazy lunch. Burgers and salads were great. Cocktails seemed pricey.', 'Great venue, lovely food, amazing service, incredible drinks, loved meeting Head Chef Tom at the pudding bar and loved the kitchen tour:)', 'Fabulous restaurant excellent food Excellent service by very friendly and attentive staff. Lovely atmosphere with fabulous music. Cocktails delicious ', \"Came in for a quick lunch Friday afternoon, was a little bit hesitant to sit outside but it was really nice and cozy with all the heaters and rugs. We had a couple of lattes and salads (I had goats cheese my friend had the thai veg with chicken) & honestly wasn't really expecting much but I've literally made an account because of how impressed I was when I left. The food was delicious (one of the best salads I've had!) our server Jordan was attentive & charming and the atmosphere was great. Can't wait to head back and try more of the menu!\", \"Favorite place for drinks on the big island - we circled it over 2 weeks. Great view, good entertainment, and excellent staff. Drinks are great. Mai Tai is the best version I've tasted. Menu is casual but everything we had in 3 visits was very tasty. Definitely one of the best places in the world to watch the sunset over drinks and bites.\", 'Really, the coffee tastes great with different flavors, they have healthy dishes and wonderful flavors, they have comfortable and quiet sitting places, you can sit and see the beautiful Haga Street. Fantastic place for relaxing, I advise everyone to try this cafe.', 'Have been here many times and have always loved whatever I order. Food very tasty, normally served promptly. Friendly efficient service. Good value.', \"Fantastic! The service was fantastic and they relocated us to a table with a view! The food was amazing, and they were so humble. They didn't make me feel embarrassed to ask for a pic by the window, it was amazing!\", \"Had a horrible experience here at our last visit, my son has severe dairy/egg allergies, when meal was delivered right before he took a bite I noticed what looked like butter under the first layer of steamed broccoli, extremely upset I walked right into their kitchen, manager came running, he told me it wasn't butter but when he inspected it he admitted it was, he yelled at employee responsible \", 'Pretty mediocre, but the prices are fair and they really cram all the \"stuff\" in there.', \"The sweet and sour chicken was disgusting. I was very disappointed in this place. Service wasn't that great either.\", 'Had a great dinner here for a low price! The dishes were awesome and vey filling while the waiter was a great help and very nice in getting our order last minute.

Can not but recommend.', 'Food is good for this type of restaurant, although the service is very slow. The music is offensively loud and when asked if they would turn it down we were told that it is the owner\\'s concept that the music was played at that level. This is a family meal at 5.30 on a Saturday evening, you couldn\\'t hear the questions asked by the waitress nor your own voice responding. There is a lot of competition on Beech Road. Perhaps the owners may like to think whether their \"concept\" is more important than the customer. Certainly these customers won\\'t be returning.', 'Poor customer service and incredibly expensive beer.', 'Very tasty and delicious food and the service was very good', 'The food looked beautiful at first glance but it was cold (sealed tuna, lamb kebab, duck), it lacked flavour and being prepared when ordered. It seemed that each tapa was prepared some hours before, put in the fridge and then cut and put beautifully in the plate. Overpriced and pretensious. Very disappointing experience.', 'The prices in this Dublin wine bar had me worried. But the menu is top quality', \"Definitely a bad experience. A warm welcome then average food and service and then the nailing. We were charged for stuff we did not order (but was put on the table) and got a very unexpected bill. It's not aimed for returning customers more like a tourist trap.\", 'My son had chicken fingers and fries. Unfortunately, he didn’t cate for them. He said the chicken was dry. My daughter got a Cesar salad and didn’t care for her meal either. The dressing wasn’t the creamy type we prefer. It was more oily. For my meal, I first asked for a salmon sandwich and was told they were out. I then asked for the chicken salad wrap and was told they were out. Then I asked for a salmon burger and, again, was told they were out. I settled on the simple salmon salad. It was just okay. There wasn’t much flavor and only ate about half. Overall, our experience with the food wasn’t great, but our waitress was very friendly. Regardless, we won’t be back.', 'The food was inventive and delicious. Service friendly and prompt.

Better still, I accidentally ordered a biryani with chicken in it (I'm a vegetarian) and they took it back and changed it for a veggie biryani without charging me for it, even though it was totally my fault. That's classy. They also wouldn't take any service charge...Would definitely come again!\", 'Went to the local pub to ask for a recommendation (and a pint of course) and was told to come here.Wasn’t disappointed and really enjoyed the food.Recently I’ve not bothered with rice, and have found a Naan bread and curry enough, and that was the case here. Garlic naan was hot, fresh, doughy in the middle and crisp on the outside and smothered in garlic. Could have enjoyed it as a meal on its own.Had tandoori chicken masala that was just the right heat and plenty of sauce for dipping into. My wife did have rice and a house special curry. What I tasted of both were just as good and probably a bit more complex flavour and ingredients.We didn’t push the boat out but did have a couple of drinks and the whole thing came to well under £50 for two great curries and a few sides ( we did have the compulsory popadoms and pickles).Can’t compare with the other options on Brick Lane but really enjoyed this and the staff were friendly and helpful too.', \"While visiting London and staying in Brick Lane, we checked into our hotel in the early hours of the morning. We saw that The Monsoon was open so headed in for a meal. They had closed for the evening but cooked us a meal for us to take away . While waiting, we were able to have a drink. As we were in a hotel room, we had no cutlery or bowls to use, so staff sorted us some plastic cutlery and two plastic take away pots for us to use as bowls. They even threw in a bottle of Cobra. They couldn't have been more helpful, in the early hours of the morning, to make sure we could eat, especially as they were probably about to head home themselves...thankyou.\", 'Great service. Computerised order screen make it really easy. Order on the screen and just sit down..and they bring you your food to the table...yes I did say they bring you your food. This was faster than going to any drive in that I have visited before.', 'Great burgers. I heard some pretty bad press about this place, but everything from food to staff and interior was more than good enough.', \"This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.\", 'This is a small ramen restaurant. I waited so long in line with my family during the winter that I actually went across the street to another Japanese restaurant that served bento and sushi to eat before. I did it mainly because I was freezing. Kodawari is a small little restaurant that serves pretty good ramen, but not the best I have had. I messed up and had the original ramen so there was not much to brag about. My nephew had their specialty black sesame ramen and said it was great. We ate upstairs at the large table where you share space since it was the only table to seat 5. Overall, a good place to eat if you do not have to wait. Prices are above ramen average.', \"I tried over 10 chicken rice eateries in Singapore and this is by far my #1 favorite!  The chicken is so tender and delicious that I wouldn't mind having it everything!  Go early as they close their stall when everything is sold, as I got there once at 6:30pm and the staff were cleaning up since everything was sold out, even though the Maxwell Food Center where the stall is located closes at 8pm.\", \"They were able to accommodate our allergies.  The waiter wasn't sure about all of the items on the menu, but was able to give answers about what my son could have after checking with the kitchen.  My son had a safe meal, so I consider it a success!\", 'Good price, very good services, 3 portions of food cost 120 euro, very good position, cheap drinks .', \"As far as I'm concerned, Wendy's all beef burgers are every bit as good as In N' Out! Maybe even better! Baconator Rules!\", 'I am a very picky eater who dislikes pork, however, Schiller Braeu made me change my mind about German food. Before I went to Germany, I decided to eat nothing but pastry as I did in Vienna years ago. I went restaurants just to keep my husband company and only had a few bites of his meat dishes. At Schiller Braeu I learned to enjoy German sausages and potato sides. Even the sour sauerkraut in Germany was delicious, unlike what we buy from North American market. The restaurant has a very pleasant local atmosphere and the most hard-working waitresses considering how many large glasses of beer that they had to carry!', \"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.\", 'Friendly. Expected tagine to be pieces rather than a chicken leg. They need to sort heating out. It was cold inside. Drinks were nice. Perhaps cut the whirling dervish music.', \"Came here with a large group for drinks after a brunch. The atmosphere is great and the drinks menu extensive (if a little overpriced). The only downside was that one member of our party was looking for some food but they wouldn't let her order anything except for a three course set menu.\", \"I saw this spot on Instagram/Yelp so I had to try it out! I got the sampler and ordered online thru their website. The food looked amazing. Was happy it came with multiple sauces but the best was their homemade sauce. The fish was delicious, all equally great! The hush puppies was on the hard side, perhaps the result of driving ~20 minutes home. The fries were good. I'd definitely come back!\", 'Great Location, good food and friendly staff. Even though our waitor \"forgot\" us when we wanted to pay for the meal', 'Steak was cook just the way I requested medium rare. Service was good. It should of better', \"It's a bit ghetto but the staff are friendly and they do get your food out in record time ( even when they are packed )\", 'The breakfast sandwiches were incredible. And no wait. Go! You wont be sorry.', \"Cosy cafe on popular street of Haga. They offer hot and cold drinks, food like salad, soup and sandwiches plus some sweets and baked goods. Soup of the day was really good, the salad w chevre was nice but since the cheese was baked in filo dough and then placed directly on the vegetables it became soggy, would have been better if the cheese came on its own plate (or the veggies were less wet). Coffe was good and the almond cookie with nuts and berries was delicious, it don't look like much but it was really chewy and nice. We where allowed to bring the baby stroller inside the cafe but they didn't have a changing table in the restroom.\", 'Just move to the area and looking for another place I just found this one, What a nice place! Great breakfast (Complete breakfast with Slice Potatoes and Steak) is the best one!! Also you can pay with Cashapp', \"Great food and atmosphere. The bofsandwich..... Just something else and definitely don't think it's just a burger... It's not\", 'The exceedingly good Italian we didn’t know we needed', 'The coleslaw and cornbread were unbelievable! Ribs were okay and my wife enjoyed her fish and chips. Great service made up for the okay ribs. Would recommend this place over any other restaurant on the strip. Plus it was nice to be by the water!', 'They know what they are doing and they do it extremely well', \"Really worth it I would say if u are going for new year's or just important ocassion. Some people would say overpriced but hands down one of the best restaurants I been in London in a long time. Service was incredible, and food arrived faster than expected.\", 'I’ve been there many time, I tried pretty much all the different kind of ramen. I love them all. The place is really nice, I like the staff behavior, you order and get your food quickly and then nobody is pushing you out. It’s really my best ramen experience.', \"My husband and I came for date night. We wanted to eat somewhere in Hampstead and after checking online and seeing the amazing reviews we thought we'd give it a try because we love Indian food! The restaurant did not disappoint and the food tasted great. It's a family friendly restaurant and the staff really pay attention to your needs and cater according to what you ask. Will definitely be back :) (forgot to take a picture of the mains, but starters were prawn puri and lamb chops)\", 'Really nice food for alright prices', 'A nice variety of choices, delicious food we liked it. I think its a popular place, we went without a reservation waited at the bar a little. The steakes we chose were good. We enjoyed the camember. The only thing I didn’t like was the tiny tables (which were everywhere in France) you have hard time placing your glass, you water, the dish etc.', 'The food was excellent and interesting. There was a bit of a wait between being seated and receiving water for which a choice had been requested. This seemed odd given that we had been instructed to arrive promptly.', 'This comes from a New Yorker, hamburgers and fries are great.Breakfast all day, and you can have lunch after other restaurants close and late night dinner. Love their Whispering Angel rose, actually visited the vineyard, about 1 hour south west from Cannes, worth a visit. Great service. A great New York steak is almost impossible to find in France, that’s why I settle for Filet Mignon du Boeuf, you can’t loose. A filet mignon actually refers to pork, so be to clarify. If you have a hamburger clarify what you would like on it, they otherwise put on some kind of home mayo version.', \"We took our 2 daughters and 4 nieces and nephews (ages 5-13) here, many for their first hibachi experience. \\xa0 \\xa0We've been going to this Kobe since i was a kid when we visited Disney. \\xa0 The wait staff, chef and food was all amazing!!! The restaurant was clean and we enjoyed our time. \\xa0The outside area around the restaurant has gone downhill over the years and could stand to be cleaned up a bit but that is our only suggestion! \", 'Very professional and kind service, we took test menù was good , some dishes better than other but in general was ok, atmosphere nice but could be better. Price for what you have it’s not expensive. Compliments to the Italian girl that took care to our table.', 'Family of 4 for dinner and service was very good along with quality and quantity of food. The famed US customer service has not been what I expected over the last 2 weeks but this was exactly what I was expecting, warm welcome and attentive service. Food was good quality with no complaints from two teenagers. Only downside was being charged for one of the boys playing a game on the table monitor. He said it did not warn him there was a charge and thankfully he only played one game but beware.', 'Awesome Indian food and staff, Abdur and Rahman helped us a lot because se didnt know what to order. We Will repeat for sure', \"They were able to provide an PA friendly meal for my son, but it was one of those situations where I had to trust that they knew what they were doing. There was no explanation, or allergen list. I chose something that wasn't likely to contain peanuts and asked them to prepare it away from peanuts. And they did. \", \"The 14 course or even more was just mind blowing. I couldn't have imagined this to happen again, from daulat ki chaat to samosa to galauti to crabs to shikanji and what not. Do dine at the restaurant to experience the same\", 'We went in unplanned based on a high percentage of “Indian” looking customers. We were not disappointed. Food was lovely; service great.', 'I just want to say that the Bacon Bourbon Cheeseburger is one of the best fast food burgers I’ve ever had. There’s only been a few moments in my life where I’ve wanted to leave a review about something, and this is one of them.', \"Very pricey, but like most Michelin restaurants, you are paying for the experience. We had the chef's choice menu, which was supposed to be 4 courses but wound up being more like 7. Excellent food and service.\", 'The manager came to the table. He double checked some things with the chef. He was able to get the Ham with the sides switched to French Fries. They found a safe sauce for him. The serving size was huge and he really enjoyed everything. ', 'the crabs were amazing!! the wait was a bit long but they have a telephone alert system that works pretty well. what can I say, the crabs were amazing.', \"The restuarant has made its way to world's top 50 restuarants and it clearly lives up to its reputation. \", 'Food was good. Bartender service was horrid. ', \"Chef did come out to speak to my son dairy, and nut allergic.  The waiter was good.. when they were serving the food he came over immediately and noticed that my son's dish had the meatball (with dairy) and the meatsauce (no dairy)  and took it from the serving person before putting it in front of my son and they got a him a new dish.. luckily something that was quick. Overall a good experience, not as good as the first time\", \"There really isn't anything to complain about. We had done our research. We knew what we came for - and we got what we wanted.\", ' it does not disappoint although I do not think it is worth paying the extra to go beyond the 86th floor. Visited both during the day and at night and quite different experiences', 'Nice food and great service but very empty at 5.30. Some items on the menu not available. Otherwise good. Would go again', 'This is my second time and it did not dissapoint.', 'We have been here many times and have never had a bad thing to say- well other than the fact that we ate too much!! The service is good, food is good, drinks were good.. Highly recommend!', 'We made the reservation on Open Table. com which allows you to indicate special needs.  I called prior to the reservation spoke to the hostess (manager unavailable) and she said they would have problem accommodating us.  when we arrived, allison, the manager came to our table asked us specifically about the allergies,told us what was safe, what was made in the shared fryer, told us she would go down and take a fresh piece of meat out for us and made sure the server was there to hear all of it. They did an excellent job and this is the second time we have dined here. Prior experience was just as good.  ', 'Very good. I found the crispy chicken a bit too salty, but generally great food and great atmosphere.

Indeed, in this case the food is exactly what you would expect from a tourist trap in Rome: average/ good but not exceptional, and definitely with a low quality/price ratio.

Next time i’m in london i’ll go to monsoon again!', \"While visiting London and staying in Brick Lane, we checked into our hotel in the early hours of the morning. We saw that The Monsoon was open so headed in for a meal. They had closed for the evening but cooked us a meal for us to take away . While waiting, we were able to have a drink. As we were in a hotel room, we had no cutlery or bowls to use, so staff sorted us some plastic cutlery and two plastic take away pots for us to use as bowls. They even threw in a bottle of Cobra. They couldn't have been more helpful, in the early hours of the morning, to make sure we could eat, especially as they were probably about to head home themselves...thankyou.\", 'The Munchner Stubn is a very traditional German restaurant, so if you like meat and beer, you have come to the right place.', \"This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.\", 'Could not recommend this restaurant highly enough!', 'Every portion of food they put out there is well thought out and balanced. There will always be a couple of dishes that are not seasoned as per your preference, but the majority are. Especially the desserts are mouth watering!', \"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.\", 'Our lunch was wonderful and not rushed. We started with the steak tartare, a highlight for sure!! Big hits at the table were the clam chowder and the burger with side salad.', 'Steak was cook just the way I requested medium rare. Service was good. It should of better', 'Whenever we order Schnitzel we tend to overestimate our ability to eat the huge portions and this meal was no exception. It was very nice but it left no room for a dessert. A nice touch was a group of musicians who provided pleasant entertainment. Don’t hope to get a table in the evening without a reservation. This is not the best part of Munich but don’t let it put you off dining here.', 'The breakfast sandwiches were incredible. And no wait. Go! You wont be sorry.', \"Great food and atmosphere. The bofsandwich..... Just something else and definitely don't think it's just a burger... It's not\", 'The exceedingly good Italian we didn’t know we needed', 'This is the only pub around the area so worth knowing if you fancy a pint!', 'Really nice food for alright prices', 'Excellent coffee, baked goods, and chocolate.    This is the perfect place to have a business coffee meeting.  Nothing like the crowded, messy, dirty, teenager-y (sorry kids) Starbucks that are on every corner.  If you need to have a business meeting over coffee, this is your place  This seems to be the current demographic of patrons.  Not many un-business folks here.  More professionals than random folks/tourists/etc. wandering the area.', 'Very professional and kind service, we took test menù was good , some dishes better than other but in general was ok, atmosphere nice but could be better. Price for what you have it’s not expensive. Compliments to the Italian girl that took care to our table.', 'Family of 4 for dinner and service was very good along with quality and quantity of food. The famed US customer service has not been what I expected over the last 2 weeks but this was exactly what I was expecting, warm welcome and attentive service. Food was good quality with no complaints from two teenagers. Only downside was being charged for one of the boys playing a game on the table monitor. He said it did not warn him there was a charge and thankfully he only played one game but beware.', \"It's a really cute place with two floors. Then I felt like I was back in Miami Beach with the bathroom charges at the door. The food was standard for the restaurant chain. The atmosphere was fun.\", \"They were able to provide an PA friendly meal for my son, but it was one of those situations where I had to trust that they knew what they were doing. There was no explanation, or allergen list. I chose something that wasn't likely to contain peanuts and asked them to prepare it away from peanuts. And they did. \", \"The 14 course or even more was just mind blowing. I couldn't have imagined this to happen again, from daulat ki chaat to samosa to galauti to crabs to shikanji and what not. Do dine at the restaurant to experience the same\", 'We went in unplanned based on a high percentage of “Indian” looking customers. We were not disappointed. Food was lovely; service great.', 'We had a jolly evening last Sunday having tried a range of both vegan and meaty plates. We also drank a remarkable white wine - Binyamina Gewürztraminer. The waitress whose name I never asked for (I only know she was Italian) attended to us with highest standards of professionalism and friendliness. I shall definitely return soon.', 'Food and atmosphere even better than my favourite Indian restaurants in England! And even better, lots of vegan choices!', \"There really isn't anything to complain about. We had done our research. We knew what we came for - and we got what we wanted.\", 'This is my second time and it did not dissapoint.', 'Aaaaammazing. Just ask the server what the most popular things are and order those. There is one sandwich in particular as small plate-- to die for.', 'our visit to the 102nd floor was an absolute highlight—not just because of the views, but because of Ranita, our host in the observatory. An Empire State Building employee for 25 (!!) years, she is clearly so dedicated to her job and making visitors feel welcome. Thank you Ranita for a visit our kids won’t soon forget.', 'Dropped in to the Hyatt to meet someone. A pot of decent coffee (2.5 cups) in the lounge in comfortable and spacious surroundings £3.50! Why on earth go to a coffee shop chain!!!', 'We went in not long after we arrived in Dublin and immediately were impressed. The staff, like most Dubliners, were engaging and witty.

What sets The Monsoon aside is that once they sit you down they act like they don’t need your business. They were the rudest staff I have dealt with in a long time. They kept storming around the restaurant floor, the head waiter twice leaning against my table (which I hate but can forgive), they kept taking away the courses before I had finished, and by the timely came to dessert or coffee I felt rushed out the door so just paid and left. On and food was poor, with the exception of the bhaji. I will never eat there again. Brilliant restaurants just down the street that have given me excellent food and service every time.', 'Yes, the previous feedback are absolutely right. They always do this things.

The service is slow and it it is also a bit expensive', 'Strongly unrecommended!', 'Vinegarry wine, bored looking staff, and all the fresh energy of an overstuffed victorian teahouse. This was definitely a disappointment.', \"Atmosphere is good. However the food wasn't very good. If you want to try make sure you don't seat out side. My sister had a bird poo on top of her head... lol\", 'Whilst good these are not much different from other shops.

Tasteless soups, uncomfortable seating, but great decor and sound track reproducing Tokyo suburb cheap joint.', 'Iâ€™m traveling for work and my options were limited.

I don't mind paying some extra for good food and excellent views, but in this restaurant you are lucky if don't get food poison! The food was uneatable and the prices were ridiculously high! Shame\", 'Went here because it was close to the Eiffel Tower and someone mentioned it was famous. What they didn’t mention is what it’s famous for because it’s definitely not for the food. I feel like I need to go and eat elsewhere just to get this taste and experience erased from memory. There are too many excellent choices in Paris to lose one here. Big avoid', 'Definitely less than expected!! ', 'This used to be a Priority-go-to even though their pesto and meatballs contained pine nuts. The staff were always very helpful and knowledgeable and we felt comfortable there. They also double check all of the orders with the chef. On our last visit we noticed some changes to the menu and an addition of  Mortadella Di Bolognawith with pistachios. This caused some discomfort for several reasons. Have not been back since. ', \"Being living in Shanghai, i've been in several excellent cantonese restaurant i have to recon the place serve high quality food but it is quite boring in the restaurant frankly, and there is no surprise in the menu of interpretations of the classics. \", 'Myself and my partner visited this little trattoria towards the end of our stay in Gothenburg. The food really was amazing, we really could not fault it, but the service left a little to be desired, we found the manager, well, we assume he was the manager, to be very abrupt and impatient with us when we ordered. There was one other visible member of staff the night we visited who appeared to be run off our feet. Between finishing our meal and having the opportunity to ask for the bill, we had a very long wait...the female waitress we had seen earlier was busy out back with other customers, whilst the manager serving customers our front seemed to be tied up in a lengthy conversation (very lengthy) with patrons he already knew. This left us, and several others on other tables, looking very anxious to be served. This looks to be a rare occurrence as others have reported prompt service, but new customers that night appeared to be very undervalued.', 'What a bummy place. Shut it down now. This place is a absolute disgrace. I would rather eat dog food', \"Long wait, but good service for the moment.  Mcdonald's staff must moov more faster.  They talk to much and work slowly!\", \"We did a pizza tour of the North End for lunch this weekend and went here on all the recommendations. I've had better pizza in a mall food court, I just don't understand the love of this one. The other 4 places we tried were miles above this one. Very doughy, cheese barely melted and sauce not very flavorful. I'll pass on this one next time, almost $10 for two slices we didn't enjoy :(\", 'We booked a table for family and were at the place on time. But were booted out to accommodate fairer skin people who were waiting without a reservation. I guess we can’t get over colour superiority. Wherever we see fairer lot, we tend to bow down to them. We gotta stop this guys. To hell with these people and to hell with RAJDOOT.', 'Slightly nervous, no one wanted to wear face masks', 'The flavor is unbelievably wrong. I have a metal flavor stuck in my mouth from this.', 'Just a hec of a lot of food with little flavor…Bloody Mary best part of the meal.', 'We the worst experience ever! My family came to visit from Switzerland and was very happy to take them to a place with good food and nice atmosphere, but we had neither good food or nice atmosphere!\\xa0', 'We had my birthday breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. The restaurant had a good gluten-free menu, I am celiac so have to follow a strict gluten-free diet. I made my server aware and she was really good. We all received our breakfasts, which were lovely. I had just taken a bite from the toast and the server came over and said that it wasn’t gluten-free toast! I was mortified. The manager came over and apologised half heartedly. And said accidents do happen! Which was no help to me, that was my birthday ruined. I was very poorly that night and I am still suffering. The whole trip to Vegas was to celebrate my birthday with family and friends. Safely to say I won’t be visiting this restaurant again. The other meals were great and were enjoyed. It’s a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere. Recommend it, but not if you are celiac or have allergies.', \"Lunched today and just about OK. Lovely people running the restaurant which is clearly popular with locals but certainly one we wouldn't rush back to.\", 'Grossly undercooked initial effort was subjected to another round in the kitchen that rendered it inedible.

Better still, I accidentally ordered a biryani with chicken in it (I'm a vegetarian) and they took it back and changed it for a veggie biryani without charging me for it, even though it was totally my fault. That's classy. They also wouldn't take any service charge...Would definitely come again!\", \"While visiting London and staying in Brick Lane, we checked into our hotel in the early hours of the morning. We saw that The Monsoon was open so headed in for a meal. They had closed for the evening but cooked us a meal for us to take away . While waiting, we were able to have a drink. As we were in a hotel room, we had no cutlery or bowls to use, so staff sorted us some plastic cutlery and two plastic take away pots for us to use as bowls. They even threw in a bottle of Cobra. They couldn't have been more helpful, in the early hours of the morning, to make sure we could eat, especially as they were probably about to head home themselves...thankyou.\", 'The Munchner Stubn is a very traditional German restaurant, so if you like meat and beer, you have come to the right place.', \"Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.\", 'Could not recommend this restaurant highly enough!', ' Everything is so tasty, you cannot restraint yourself from having all of the dishes.', \"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.\", 'Friendly. Expected tagine to be pieces rather than a chicken leg. They need to sort heating out. It was cold inside. Drinks were nice. Perhaps cut the whirling dervish music.', 'This is easily one of, if not the best meal we’ve ever eaten. I cannot recommend this place enough!', 'Our lunch was wonderful and not rushed. We started with the steak tartare, a highlight for sure!! Big hits at the table were the clam chowder and the burger with side salad.', 'Whenever we order Schnitzel we tend to overestimate our ability to eat the huge portions and this meal was no exception. It was very nice but it left no room for a dessert. A nice touch was a group of musicians who provided pleasant entertainment. Don’t hope to get a table in the evening without a reservation. This is not the best part of Munich but don’t let it put you off dining here.', \"Wowww. This bread. These people. I never make a point of reviewing anything but I can't say enough good things about the Izola team and the community Jeffrey has created for the east village and bread lovers everywhere. \\xa0Do yourself a favor -- order a loaf of the wild sourdough and an almond croissant next time you're in the neighborhood. You won't regret it.\", 'The breakfast sandwiches were incredible. And no wait. Go! You wont be sorry.', 'Order a cheese with normal crust with bacon and pineapple. The crust was perfect. The cheese was abundant and the pineapple was full rings. Cost was good and the delivery via GrubHub was fast. Please try this pizza if visiting Boston', \"Great food and atmosphere. The bofsandwich..... Just something else and definitely don't think it's just a burger... It's not\", 'The exceedingly good Italian we didn’t know we needed', \"My husband and I came for date night. We wanted to eat somewhere in Hampstead and after checking online and seeing the amazing reviews we thought we'd give it a try because we love Indian food! The restaurant did not disappoint and the food tasted great. It's a family friendly restaurant and the staff really pay attention to your needs and cater according to what you ask. Will definitely be back :) (forgot to take a picture of the mains, but starters were prawn puri and lamb chops)\", 'Very professional and kind service, we took test menù was good , some dishes better than other but in general was ok, atmosphere nice but could be better. Price for what you have it’s not expensive. Compliments to the Italian girl that took care to our table.', 'Family of 4 for dinner and service was very good along with quality and quantity of food. The famed US customer service has not been what I expected over the last 2 weeks but this was exactly what I was expecting, warm welcome and attentive service. Food was good quality with no complaints from two teenagers. Only downside was being charged for one of the boys playing a game on the table monitor. He said it did not warn him there was a charge and thankfully he only played one game but beware.', \"It's a really cute place with two floors. Then I felt like I was back in Miami Beach with the bathroom charges at the door. The food was standard for the restaurant chain. The atmosphere was fun.\", \"They were able to provide an PA friendly meal for my son, but it was one of those situations where I had to trust that they knew what they were doing. There was no explanation, or allergen list. I chose something that wasn't likely to contain peanuts and asked them to prepare it away from peanuts. And they did. \", \"The 14 course or even more was just mind blowing. I couldn't have imagined this to happen again, from daulat ki chaat to samosa to galauti to crabs to shikanji and what not. Do dine at the restaurant to experience the same\", 'We went in unplanned based on a high percentage of “Indian” looking customers. We were not disappointed. Food was lovely; service great.', 'We had a jolly evening last Sunday having tried a range of both vegan and meaty plates. We also drank a remarkable white wine - Binyamina Gewürztraminer. The waitress whose name I never asked for (I only know she was Italian) attended to us with highest standards of professionalism and friendliness. I shall definitely return soon.', \"The restuarant has made its way to world's top 50 restuarants and it clearly lives up to its reputation. \", \"There really isn't anything to complain about. We had done our research. We knew what we came for - and we got what we wanted.\", 'This is my second time and it did not dissapoint.', 'They were very willing to accommodate our severe allergies', 'Forest & Plate has been one of the top restaurants in my list of all times. There is so much love and creativeness put into the plate of fresh salads, pastas and all the other dishes', 'our visit to the 102nd floor was an absolute highlight—not just because of the views, but because of Ranita, our host in the observatory. An Empire State Building employee for 25 (!!) years, she is clearly so dedicated to her job and making visitors feel welcome. Thank you Ranita for a visit our kids won’t soon forget.', 'Dropped in to the Hyatt to meet someone. A pot of decent coffee (2.5 cups) in the lounge in comfortable and spacious surroundings £3.50! Why on earth go to a coffee shop chain!!!']\n",

I’d didn’t feel like an occasion dining out, just nice dining out experience', 'Desert was great, starter and main (steak) would not recommend...', 'No reasonably priced set lunch menu.\\xa0', 'They don’t have a chef and they just warm the foods because they’re already cooked it and it comes in packaged when you order they just warm the food and topped with oil to look nice', 'Every Indian restaurant on brick lane woo you at the door with offers of free beer or wine, a history of great reviews and celebrity endorsements. What sets The Monsoon aside is that once they sit you down they act like they don’t need your business. They were the rudest staff I have dealt with in a long time. They kept storming around the restaurant floor, the head waiter twice leaning against my table (which I hate but can forgive), they kept taking away the courses before I had finished, and by the timely came to dessert or coffee I felt rushed out the door so just paid and left. On and food was poor, with the exception of the bhaji. I will never eat there again. Brilliant restaurants just down the street that have given me excellent food and service every time.', 'Strongly unrecommended!', \"Atmosphere is good. However the food wasn't very good. If you want to try make sure you don't seat out side. My sister had a bird poo on top of her head... lol\", 'Sushi tastes weird andthe plates are in paper. Wouldnt go here again', 'the staff is a bit untrained and difficult to get a seat.', 'Never ever go to this place they charge us for bread and they told it is 100 lira per person and they lied , theyWill try to stole u as much as they can', 'The large buns have a core that is not really baked. It will be like a lump. Discovered the lump at home - therefore I did not complain on the spot.', 'Iâ€™m traveling for work and my options were limited. I told them I had a nut allergy and they didnâ€™t seem knowledgeable if their items had nuts in it but â€œwould make a note of itâ€\\x9d. Didnâ€™t like that at all', \"It was a nice setting but I can't recommend. Food is bad\", \"Stay away! I don't mind paying some extra for good food and excellent views, but in this restaurant you are lucky if don't get food poison! The food was uneatable and the prices were ridiculously high! Shame\", 'Went here because it was close to the Eiffel Tower and someone mentioned it was famous. What they didn’t mention is what it’s famous for because it’s definitely not for the food. I feel like I need to go and eat elsewhere just to get this taste and experience erased from memory. There are too many excellent choices in Paris to lose one here. Big avoid', \"A very nice place. Very good home flan, but tiramisu is not the best unfortunately. Someone forgot the coffee marinade in the cake. Still, it's really tasty and I recommend this place. I won't say anything about food because we didn't eat anything there.\", \"My SO and I went here, with a hankering for good, wood fired pizza. I was very let down. The place was very busy, so service was hit and miss. We were not told about the BYO until we were seated and tried to order drinks. Thankfully there is a Co-op over the road. We both ordered pizza. these were billed as Neapolitian, sourdough, wood fired. So I was expecting, thin and crispy with a great tomato sauce. When the pizza arrived, it looked good. A bit of char on the edge, as you would expect. A good amount of toppings and a nice aroma. When I cut my pizza to pick it up (who eats pizza with a knife and folk?) The middle was soggy. half the toppings fell off. There was too much liquid coming off the cheese. I was very disapointed. My SO's pizza was the same. I really hope that this was a one off, as I would love to have a good pizza place nearby but I have not been back.\", 'The food was nice, but we had a dreadful waiter', 'Definitely less than expected!! ', 'This used to be a Priority-go-to even though their pesto and meatballs contained pine nuts. The staff were always very helpful and knowledgeable and we felt comfortable there. They also double check all of the orders with the chef. On our last visit we noticed some changes to the menu and an addition of  Mortadella Di Bolognawith with pistachios. This caused some discomfort for several reasons. Have not been back since. ', \"Being living in Shanghai, i've been in several excellent cantonese restaurant i have to recon the place serve high quality food but it is quite boring in the restaurant frankly, and there is no surprise in the menu of interpretations of the classics. \", 'Myself and my partner visited this little trattoria towards the end of our stay in Gothenburg. The food really was amazing, we really could not fault it, but the service left a little to be desired, we found the manager, well, we assume he was the manager, to be very abrupt and impatient with us when we ordered. There was one other visible member of staff the night we visited who appeared to be run off our feet. Between finishing our meal and having the opportunity to ask for the bill, we had a very long wait...the female waitress we had seen earlier was busy out back with other customers, whilst the manager serving customers our front seemed to be tied up in a lengthy conversation (very lengthy) with patrons he already knew. This left us, and several others on other tables, looking very anxious to be served. This looks to be a rare occurrence as others have reported prompt service, but new customers that night appeared to be very undervalued.', 'Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.', 'What a bummy place. Shut it down now. This place is a absolute disgrace. I would rather eat dog food', \"Long wait, but good service for the moment.  Mcdonald's staff must moov more faster.  They talk to much and work slowly!\", 'We booked a table for family and were at the place on time. But were booted out to accommodate fairer skin people who were waiting without a reservation. I guess we can’t get over colour superiority. Wherever we see fairer lot, we tend to bow down to them. We gotta stop this guys. To hell with these people and to hell with RAJDOOT.', 'Slightly nervous, no one wanted to wear face masks', 'Trying to be creative, definitely not authentic middle eastern food', 'You can not see the prices of any of what you have to order, a little short of space as well.', 'Food with sugar...🤢🤮', 'Expensive and crepes not good. Don’t recommend it at all.', 'Just few words: 80€ for two plat, 2 desserts and 6 glass of wine. I like the place, really very romantic, but too much expensive for nothing special.', 'Just a hec of a lot of food with little flavor…Bloody Mary best part of the meal.', 'Party of five adults w reservation for 7:30 pm.Appealing menu. Very noisy. Server had to shout in order for us to hear her. We were not able to talk across the table, so we left with apologies and went to Bar Boulud across the street', 'They were able to accomodate me, but the dish that they brought out bore little resemblance to what I had ordered. When they have to alter a dish so much, I prefer a little warning. ', '1. Hot food is fine 2. Limited you can order 5 dishes every 600 seconds. 3. Not sure it is real salmon & tuna 4. I order Salmon roe sushi but the serve Tobiko sushi', 'We the worst experience ever! My family came to visit from Switzerland and was very happy to take them to a place with good food and nice atmosphere, but we had neither good food or nice atmosphere!\\xa0', 'We had my birthday breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. The restaurant had a good gluten-free menu, I am celiac so have to follow a strict gluten-free diet. I made my server aware and she was really good. We all received our breakfasts, which were lovely. I had just taken a bite from the toast and the server came over and said that it wasn’t gluten-free toast! I was mortified. The manager came over and apologised half heartedly. And said accidents do happen! Which was no help to me, that was my birthday ruined. I was very poorly that night and I am still suffering. The whole trip to Vegas was to celebrate my birthday with family and friends. Safely to say I won’t be visiting this restaurant again. The other meals were great and were enjoyed. It’s a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere. Recommend it, but not if you are celiac or have allergies.', 'Reservation required. A place with few seats.', 'Beautiful place but very worthless service. Staff mainly busy with themselves, zero interest or friendliness to guests. ', \"This is the grossest restaurant I've had the misfortune to try.\", \"It was definitely the most overrated sushi restaurant I've been so far. I've checked that iSamsi was inthe top ten sushi restaurant in Manchester and I don't know why. Prices are not too high but still, I expected at least decent food. Sashimi hasn't been fully cutted - we had pieces of fish still connected! How it's possible in sushi bar? Fishes had no taste. Green flower tea served in wine glass... Yes, it show's it's beauty, but it was really easy to burn lips. Someone could as well take care about interiors... It was my first and last visit in this place.\", 'Their service is good, but the food is not as good as I thought and their price is a bit high.', \"Very kind and friendly people, from corporate to the wait staff. While they were wiling work with my food allergy, they admitted that the chance of cross contamination was extremely high. They use the same grills for both cheeseburgers and regular, and the same fryers for wings and mozzarella sticks. I'm extremely sensitive so I choose to just enjoy the beer instead. \", \"Good service and nice people, but the food was unexpected with the price, and i found a lot restaurants have a good food more than this restaurant. i won't back for that restaurant\", 'The restaurant is cosy and the food is good. Yet, the waiting time are, by far, totally unacceptable.', 'Our waitress was kind and asked about allergies but she didn’t seem to understand why bread from “a local bakery” was being questioned. The manager came out and said the bakery did handle nuts. We skipped the burger my daughter wanted to eat and she ate a sandwich we brought. Good intentions here but not somewhere I’d go again with my daughter. ', 'Very unprofessional experience with Tyler, he is not very kind or thoughtful towards the elderly.', 'The restaurant was not nearly full. Maximum 1/4th. full. We were met by a middle aged waitress, not smiling, nor friendly.', \"If you like breakfast done go here,brought toast I had to get up for coffee twice I should of went to McDonald's.\", 'This iconic restaurant has fallen beyond recognition, the service, amenities and food leaves lots to wish for of what it was in the past.', 'I had the lunch menu and it was clearly not great. The burrata starter was the best but followed by a lousy US prime and a very mediocre apple tart...', 'The food wasn’t that good. The waiter Mr. Kay was very intrusive. He made our friend write a review on trip advisor and checked it. We were running late and we made that clear but he kept delaying us. Don’t advise that place at all.', \"The food was average, at best. In all my years, this was the 'sweetest' butter chicken I have been served...\\xa0\\ufeff0\"]\n"
